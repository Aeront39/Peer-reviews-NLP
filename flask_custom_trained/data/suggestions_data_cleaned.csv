0,of what code is available in the zip file most of it is understandable. the devise gem seems unnecessary to their implementation however.
0,though not much hand write but still great code with good project structure.
0, link is not submitted. i downloaded the repo and it has barely commits with basic scaffolds and schema generated for and houses
0,not unloaded on git.
0,there is no link provided. instead the code was zipped in an archive and posted on the code has no implementation of any functionality whatsoever however scaffold code files exist in the zip with nil developer implementation. code for house is added though.
0,i don see the git link here. requesting to unload the git link and deployment in instead of the project folders
0,the git repository link is not provided. a zip file is provided instead.
0,no or git link code is difficult to sort through from the zip file.
0,can not load the online page.
0,cannon run the app
0,no file found
0,the project is not deployed on either of mentioned cloud platforms such as hero was or instead an locally run server ip link is provided which does seem to work. as result i cannon test the interface at all. no is provided as well.
0,i don see the deployment to comment on this and rest other ui questions. requesting to unload the git link and deployment in instead of the project folders
0,the link seems to be local deployment.
0,all tests in the zip file are scaffold generated.
0,yes the house controller has been tested.
0,no testing has been done apart from the auto generated tests.
0,test cases for house controller have been implemented in the code. no test cases for model exist.
0,i don see the git link to comment on this. requesting the team to unload the git link and deployment in instead of the project folders
0,the link to git is not provided.
0,no git link available to track progress.
0,can not tell without git link.
1,only commits no link. hard to review. please update the submission with link so other reviewers can maybe give some proper feedback after testing the app.
0,the zip posted does seem to be updated again later after st oct
1,i don see the git link to comment on this. requesting the team to unload the git link and deployment in instead of the project folders
0,no test cases have been implemented for any entity.
0,yes the controllers have been properly tested.
0, there are some tests for the controllers but it looks like just the scaffold generated tests.
0,the team has implemented modules like login sign layout list all companies and list all houses. however they lack in many and under each module. so they are not properly implemented. they lack validations session management and things like multiple same email addresses can be registered with different users. hence no the team has not thoroughly tested at least one model or controller.
0,only the default created by the command are present in the repository.
0,there are commits done however all have been made on one day.
0,there are no proper commit messages.
0,no i just see all commits happened in one day so i don think the team has been keeping on pushing their changes.
0, no there has been only one commit on.
0,no the changes were made and pushed only in one particular day. there is no consistent flow on for pushing.
0,all the changes were pushed on single day. the last day of submission.
0,nothing mentioned in file. user interface not provided links for reactor creation. no link for house hunter.
0,basic navigation is missing. for example once user click on the edit profile and tries to navigate its difficult to return to home page. there are no details available in the file to help with the application flow.
0, file is not updated and there are no instructions on how an admin or house hunter can log in. the ui though it didn have any styling is intuitive and self explanatory.
0,no not really. the webster just has one role to operate and the file is an auto generated file which does include any useful information.
0,nearly all of the links seem to go to the wrong pages. for example back in viewing houses took me to list of users that had signed up while logged in as reactor
0,interface is very basic it lacks in many major that made the navigation through the site difficult. was not well described to understand the team work and their .
0,the file is not maintained by the developer. the design is not complete. whatever is done is intuitive but incomplete.
0,some indentation issues in the projector example in indentation is not proper. spelling example in hunters view in preferred spelling is wrong.
0,the ruby coding convention has been followed through out the project.
1,the team followed good practices. no repetition of the code. dry principles uses. how there is an empty controller though which is the commons controller what is its purpose.
1,the mac structure is good but some details should be improved.
0, yeah in way. the scaffolding generated code follows convention.
1,the code follows the common ruby on rails application structure hence it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code. it follows the common mac structure. however in some parts of the code comments were missing which was confusing as i didn understand the logic for that code. file was not properly described for other users navigating through app.
0,the application is according to the ruby practices but lacks the use of ruby features such as validations associations and active record.
1,the code is very well written properly organised and good architecture. no repetition. cons application logic written in controllers for example house controller which can be ported to the respective models.
0,the controllers are well written.
0,the code follows good ruby and rails coding practice from my point of view.
0,requesting to git link to verify the same
0,have used dry principles. the code has good readability and good naming conventions are followed. have grouped similar into classes so that it is have used such as each instead of for and while.
0,ui ux is awesome and intuitive. read me file is also well described.
0,the is empty and does not contain the admin account information. it hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is.
1,ui looks nice but i found the it to be bit confusing. the relation between user house hunter and reactor is not apparent. it would helpful if it could be explained in detail in the file.
0,the interface was simple. some of the fields input were not mentioned like for creating house
0,requesting to git link to verify the same. but downloaded the zipped file to see if there is admin credentials in file and it was not there.
0,the user interface is easy to use and the file is explicit.
0,great ui. admin dashboard looks very professional.
0,controller test cases have been covered but no model test cases can be seen.
0,tests exist for the controller but not models.
0,spec folder is not there. there are some tests in the test folder.
0,i was able to check for the reactor and house hunter. some of the functionality of reactor and were working.
0,yes you have the tests written.
1,the basics test are written. some application specific tests can be written.
0,there are only four commits visible and no proper commit messages. initial commit has file changes.
0,all commits were made on one day
0,it seems that there is only one team member pushing changes.
0,looks like the team has committed the project as whole. bug fixes are done incrementally.
0,the project has successfully named it and function names according to the principle. they are understandable form what the mean. but the project lacks any documentation internally as well as proper external file. lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code. apart from that the design of the database schema in normalized to much extent which makes data entries redundant.
0,the mac structure is completed. and basic functions have been finished.
0,the model and controller are well designed. each method covers single functionality. good job
0,from what i see it looks like code we have seen in class. although in the model classes they don have any associations between models.
1,the code itself appears to be very clean. the lack of scaffolding or the stripped down scaffolding that it presents means there a lot less dead code in the files. all the indentation and variable names appear to follow convention as well. this cleanliness on further inspection appear to stem from the fact that the application frequently does not support needed functionality. the code that there is clean though.
1,overall the code looks fine. good code is self documenting so your code could be improved by adding comments in all required places. make use of different logging options provided by for and avoid using puts in code.
1,the code is structured as per basic rails norms. the crud operations operations actions could have followed the usual norms than custom actions defined. the routes config could have been more efficiently defined using match than defining each routes separately.
1,all users have their own model controllers. the code is following ruby on rails standards but there are some debut puts that should be removed.
1,the user interface is very simple clear and straightforward. but it lacks depth where it should have been extensive. for example after signing up for the first time the user is directed by to the login page to login again. this is not very user friendly and is rather redundant. one must automatically sign in after creating an account. also the application should deduce whether i a reactor or or an admin from the email id entered. i should now have to specify for or reactor about my role.
1,the ui is basic as of now. the show profile link is broken.
0,the interface is good clean and very easy to use.
0,they are simple links to pages which does tell you where to go so it fine.
1,all the buttons which do what they say they do are quite good. quite reasonably i can click on these buttons and the expected behavior occurs. it a little weird to have to select whether i want to log in as house hunter reactor or the admin at the login screen and that it does work without selecting the right user type. unfortunately many buttons do not do what they say or redirect the application to dead page. here are the which do not work. attempting to delete real estate company makes you view real estate company detailed info. inquiries do the same. attempting to show anything that not real estate company throws. as reactor i tried to update add company information and my change was rejected. the list house form has create company as its submit button. there are also many things i expected to be able to do that there were not buttons or links for.
0,the ui is elementary but intuitive. the links have long descriptive names
0,yes it is deployed on hero
1,the login sign module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program. but this module has drawback. it deals with three tables the the and the admin. due to this kind of segmentation there is repetition of data the database if any user would like to sign as both. also it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows. according to me its better to cascade the tables of and house hunters into one. the other are not wholly implemented only the crud operations related to those are implemented hence not much could be reviewed about testing.
0,the project needs validations on all fields i was able to enter random values in email address mobile number fields. some of the additional were missing filter inquiry see who has added my house to their inquiry list etc. the project is well connected and navigation is easy. overall it looks very clean and intuitive.
1,i don think the test has been finished. the controller test file is basic empty and the same empty in the model test file.
0,no not really. no user type has all the functionality in this review check boxes much less all the functionality specified in the project description. manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty as are the fixtures.
0,no testing is not covered yet.
0,yes the team seems to have tested their completely that handles login layout and other user validations
0,admin and reactor are partially working. many other features need to implement.
0,the project only has commits all on single day. so yes it can be said that the project was implemented or developed over period of time.
0,the code was presumably unloaded in the end pushed from another repo and hence i could not see any regular commits.
0,i can not see the completed development procedure the only commit in the is on monday the week of.
0,no. they only have commits and branch so that means they waited until the last minute to do thi
1,i cannon appraise this because i do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. there is only one commit where all the functionality was added. i am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period.
0,in total there are only commits done.
0,no according to the git history there has not been no changes pushed after oct st
1,i could see only one person commits. each team member needs to contribute to git.
0,the models views and controllers have been properly designed and implemented.
0,most of the practices have been followed
0,the ruby source code appears to follow for conventions and uses few rails associations. the directory names and project structure appear to follow good for mac conventions. source code is organized and uncluttered too.
0,the code is written really well.
0,very good structure readable and names are very relevant to the functionality
0,the code is neat and precise with proper structure and comments
0,the overall ui is good but there can be some improvements made on the admin part of the app. we need to change the link manually to end up at the admin dashboard.
0,the ui is mostly easy to use but the is nearly undocumented.
0,good design and easy to use.
0,the deployed link is not accessible. the file describes the process for just admin login but not for the consequent steps.
0,the ui is straight forward and easy to use. the implementation of the menu bar makes it look better. though there is scope for improvement. the admin link in the file is not working.
0,nice user interface good use layouts. but unable to log in as admin
1,ui is nicely done. there are few things that can be improved. clear all list all houses field once search parameter has been given. do not show receiver object id in inquiries. maybe something more useful.
0,controller has been tested
0,they tested at least one controller but none of the models.
0,the team has added functionality for login through sign in but i could verify it working.
1,the reactor and house hunter controllers work as desired in most cases though there are some cases which need to be addressed. there is need to validate the real estate creation form.
0,extensive testing was done
0,yes.
0,team was active throughout the process
0,no the majority of the work was pushed on. it is an impressive product if they got all of this done in the past week.
0,there are many commits which are divided almost equally between all 
0,yes about commits were done
0,code commit frequency is good.
0,the code is very well written and arranged to be easily understandable. no extraneous code or unused code visible. dry principles have been implemented very well.
0,very clearly code
0,i think it does pretty well to follow the good ruby and rails coding practices. it is elegant and follows the dry code approach.
0,this team has followed the basic structure followed in every ruby on rails application which made my task easier to access files and understand their logic. properly described file and also one additional pdf given with application was enough to give me proper understanding of the modules.
0, file contains enough information to understand the project implementation basics.
1,please directly tall users where to sign up.
0,the user interface is very intuitive and easy to use. it is very well explained in the file. the steps to run the code are described as well.
0,yes the user interface is intuitive and easy to use. also the file has been perfectly described to give the proper idea of the flow and login credentials of an admin.
0,basic scaffold generated tests available.
0,yes from what i could see they have done well in testing at least one model and one controller.
0,team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion. i tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password email phone lengths but there were validations. hence they have perfectly focused on this parts too and tested it. i believe this has implemented through test of at least one module and controller.
0,several linear commits with good explanations available.
0,tem has properly used git and only pushed the changes when necessary and also consistently throughout the project period.
0,well written code.
0,not lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms. most of the code seems to be commented
0,the code base is very minimum. many are not implemented.
0,yes partially the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one conceivable user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct mac layout. for instance they seem to have created separate mac architectures for companies and users only. this goes to show that they are lacking in layered approach on access and privileges. also the code is written in reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self explanatory of the they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined.
0,the code is properly written with good ruby practices however no comments are mentioned.
0,it seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don get used or don have any code in them. other than that the project looks organized like ruby on rails project should be. there is lot of code that is hard to follow and i can discern its purpose in several controllers.
0,yes the code follows good ruby and rails coding practices as the models views and controllers are well defined
0, not well defined
0,the login opens the user page which has which has back links for some reason and they do not do anything. no common home page for all the list views. have to all the list views go from user pages. list of companies is not in tabulated form thus very difficult to read
0,i cannon create any hunter or reactor accounts.
1,this ui is pretty good. it fairly intuitive to follow. the only thing i recommend is to have link to the sign page on your welcome screen.
1,there is scope of improvement by eliminating multiple back links on each page.
0, file is absent.
0,admin not able to create real estate company loads error page after creating new user not able to see the user in the list could find sign up for reactor house hunter throwing an error company must exist this is because of the foreign key reference and while creating the user there is no field to select one so it gets an empty or nil value. no houses and inquiries functionality created yet. not able to check the of house hunter and reactor as was not able to sign up for that user because of the above error
1,it is not very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation not achieved in it due to the ill defined db folders and the file in git hub makes the session linkage bit hard to follow. also i fail to understand the structural flow of the program even after logging in after signing up. so i get easily confused on what to do. sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or reactor and we don know what to do and that are we or any other user. privilege separation has not been done. also the barely resolve the dilemma and is of minimal help to us to follow the steps.
0,the interface is preliminary but is easy to understand.
0,does seem like it. only user and company part have been implemented and i was able to delete the admin user easily and in the company edit view for e.g year input does check for valid year is valid year. therefore it has not been thoroughly tested
0,there seems to be many missing. i cannon register as hunter or reactor hunter reactor interest of buying model do not appear to be in the folder app models.. seems to be an incomplete project unless the previous reviewer cracked the system.
0, are incomplete while able to log in through admin cannon edit or create any other user because of the error.
0,no that does seem to be the case since it has been very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only basic login has been added. so if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an mac architecture then they have surely built bare backbone of it.
0,the team yet implemented any proper testing
0,the user model has been tested although i can say it is thorough at this point as it only tests the validity that is already required by the model.
0,the admin functionality is tested well however there are some fields like validations of phone number which are yet to be tested or improved upon
0, of are many other are yet to be implemented.
0,there are only ten commits and that too only from one account which means it has only been done by one individual and not team.
0,i did see updates and commits hours ago.
0,yes added the working timely.
0,yes seems to be so the case in effect the last commit being just hrs ago. but what changes against each file have been made is not clear hence its bit unclear as to the extent and the number of changes made. moreover the amount of subject matter and the number of sessions or models are far too less to be implementing any changes as such.
0,the team has been pushing commits in way that shows they have been making consistent progress on the project.
0,yes they have around commits.
0,i could see commits by only one person. need team contribution.
0,most files seem to be following good coding practices.
0,the file is well constructed. mac files are properly made and easy to navigate. db migrations can be seen easily as well. overall good job done on this part.
0,the app was designed according to the ruby conventions and coding practices. the necessary authorizations are used along with gems to handle user session. some models do not have the complete validations but the validations in place are using the ruby practices. the active record and association between models is also used in the project.
0,fairly good coding practices followed.
1,ui is easy to use suggestion would be to display tables of data better with better spacing the list houses page for example has the columns cramped up together
1,the user interface is very intuitive. the idea to add field for preferred contact is very smart and relevant. displaying the number of registered users however seems irrelevant to the house hunter and reactor perhaps this can be function of the admin account where it would be more relevant.
0,the ui is well built as well. specially the navigation bar at the top is delight in terms of user experience.
0,no the file tells me what i should do to test in local computer and does not offer admin information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the webster
0,yes the ui is pretty smooth and person can navigate freely. however in some cases there is no back link in the web page so the user has to use browser navigation to go to the previous page.
0,the design lacks dynamic paging for different users. all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action. ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user. it confuses the user regarding the actions he she can perform. the user needs to perform all the actions visible in the ui to know what are the actions relevant for him her. the file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user. the file currently lacks any relevant information.
0,i could only check ui. since i could not find admin and reactor code on either i believe you are yet to implement the functionality. the ui i viewed was easy to use. further site is responsive and incorporates several new features like requiring password for editing the profile. i guess that was work of gem but either way good work.
0,yes. the controller and model for handling inquiries have been thoroughly tested.
0,extra credit features have not been implemented. no sign in and no email replies
0,the default are present for some controllers. all the test are not present for the controllers. the models are not testes.
0,could not find custom tests.
0,with total of commits the team has actively pushed changes to the project. although not all commits are labeled very accurately it is still easy to comprehend the pushed changes.
0,the team kept on pushing changes throughout the project period showing timely contributions from each team member. in fact by looking at the commits each team member was probably assigned dedicated module to work on which always works well to create such big application.
0,yes through the commit record i can see that this team has been keeping pushing their changes.
0,there are more than commits and they have been working continuously
0,there were regular commits during the course of the project.
0,fairly frequent commits to git.
0,just one table is used for all users. therefore there is no distinction among the admin reactor and the house hunter
0,not much functionality is available. of what is available however the code does follow good ruby and rails coding practices
0,the code there seems to be well organized. but the problem is that many are missing and there are too much code in models and controllers.
0,code is using basic ruby on rails structure which by default provides the crud functionality but no details of admin login provided. also some of the models seem to be missing.
0,the code is well written. i noticed the controller for inquiries is well written but it is unclear how to access all those from the front end.
0,the code is very neat and easy to read but can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold.
0,user interface should not show the location users dashboard find me in app views users 
0,the application has bare minimum of what was required. a user sign and login has been implemented but no information about what type of user has signed up logged in is available. file is the default and no changes have been made to it.
0,the application portal is same for all the users. therefore all users have been given same permissions. does not contain admin credentials. hence can test admin 
0,no admin account provided. no user role selections. seems to be an incomplete project. looks like they use scaffolding to generate the templates but didn fill in the necessary code.
0,ui displays session info file paths and tags. could be improved with little efforts
0,no information for admin login credentials provided anywhere. under signing up no option to sign up as reactor or hunter is given. they should be able to do that because otherwise the are being differentiated for hunter and reactor
0,the application is deployed on hero and the user interface is easy to use.
0,the implementation can only log one type of user on and even though not specified the user has all controls so it can be assumed its an admin. can sign as well.
0,there is just one user role in the current submission. unable to test the admin functionality
0,no roles implemented.
0,basic tests are present. not custom tests though
0,no none of the controllers or models have been tested.
0,actually did find some auto generated test code for the controllers but don think it is thoroughly test. and there is no test code for the model.
0,total of commits are visible on got but do not show linear increment in the work done.
0,yes. good effort in case of pushing changes
0,no updates since days ago
0,only on days all together
0,i looked through their commits log and found that their first commit is on sep. maybe their just began to do the project on sep.
0,total of only commits has been made on days.
0,most code seems to be written with good coding practices in mind.
0,the repository looks to be set up well and the app is laid out like typical ruby on rails application. good file was present as well.
1,the code looks great. it all scaffolding and really lean view modifications.
0,good coding style names are well selected and good readability.
0,they use correct files to do specific behaviors and make advantage of the features ruby and rails provides. however i think the structure of the files is not clear enough.
0,have used dry principles. followed good coding practices.
0,the code follows the right style and in good format.
1,ui does have proper navigation in many pages. a suggestion would be to display the data in more spaced out way using tables or such methods as it looks very cramped and confusing.
0,while some links were easy to find and navigate after editing houses and companies i could not return back to good home screen. i also was unable to log out.
1,i docking some points here because hero does appear to work. i think some malicious reviewer deleted the admin and the real estate company and surprise. if company does exist it does let any user sign up. please re seed your database so i can test your app.
1,i cannon get access to the interface and the is not provided. they should provide file later to state how can i test the project.
0,have listed out the functionality which is very intuitive. but some links like as reactor and as house hunter are broken making bit of confusion.
1,deployed on hero friendly interface good file.
0,navigation is hard while some models seem to work for most cases inquiries for example is not tested as im unable to create an inquiry
0,they had good amount of tests the 
0,the code in controller files are still incomplete for crud operations so i am not aware if this was tested properly.
0,comprehensively tested for users
0,in the files they provided i found they provided test for most of controllers and models.
1,have implemented basic testing. could add more application specific test cases.
0,last commit was days ago so they are not continuous throughout the period.
0,yes it looks like all team members contributed and they have commits over the course of several weeks.
0,so many commits. it makes me proud. starting as early as september nd they make progress up until.. today. either way they passed this with flying colors.
0,about commits were done along the 
0,according to the record on they committed for many times so they may keep pushing changes.
0,evenly committed code during the project duration.
0,the team pushed changes frequently.
0,the code is very well written and organised. all the framework conventions have been followed such as the naming conventions. comments have been added at appropriate places which improved the readability.
1,yes. code is written properly. followed dry principle. added comments where possible. followed mac with rails framework.
0,first of all this webster does work at all. i can sign up as any role. and i also can get admin info from file which is an auto generated file.
0,it does well to follow the good ruby and rails coding practices. it follows the dry code approach.
1,looking at your code on you guys are following good coding practices. just at some places you have repeated you code for example in you are repeating of code. you can create one file for the repeated code and call it based on the object or move the repeated code to section and use it.
0,the git code included almost everything that follows good coding practices using ruby and rails.
0, file is not updated. could find admin credentials. the ui looked promising on the login page but the sign fails am not able to sign up either as house hunter or as reactor tried so many times in all possible ways. without these i could test any of the the error message was sign up failed please retry
0,yes. user interface is good and easy to access.
0,no the file is an auto generated file and there is no details in it.
0,a little confusing as there are two sign up forms one under the other and it is not clear what they are for.
0,only the registration page is working and the interface is quite confusing as it has sign up for both reactor and hunter on the same page which is bit confusing.
0,admin credentials not provided reactor and house hunter sign throws error so unable to use app.
0,you haven specified anything in your file. plus you have given link to hero app but its not working. please make sure its working. i saw you guys had been committing code to your master branch have you guys pushed it to hero that might be the reason it got broken.
0,the ui seems to be flexible. it could include trace back to the home page. the file could include the details to login as email. this would be helpful to use the site to it full potential.
0,no model test cases. controllers not tested exhaustively.
0,team has tested house hunter but not admin and reactor . register page asks us to put credentials twice. we are able to register for house hunter only irrespective of choosing any field house hunter or reactor hence i am not able to login into reactor account. also could not find any credentials for admin reactor or house hunter in file. hence not able to login into admin account also. new link provided in document is not working. if would be great it team could check the link and come back.
0,i don think the test part of this webster is working.
0,you guys haven implemented unit test for your project yet.
0,the house hunter model seemed to work according to most of the tasks mentioned. not for the admin and reactor ones. was unable to login as admin. was unable sign as reactor
0,excellent commit history. contributions from all team members could be seen.
0,yes i could see many push requests on the hence concluding team is pushing their changes periodically.
0,i find few changing records from but i can show the process of development.
0,yes the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period
0,there was consistent commits with spike in between when probably most development happened
0,looking at your commit history you guys started it on saturday when the submission was monday.
0,the webster did not seem to work at first. now i was able to access it. i also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. overall the team did work on updating the site 
0,only basic operation is available. need to add lots of functionality.
0,the git repo shows total of commits. although majority of the places ruby standards have been followed but at some places variables names such as does not show any relevancy or understanding to the reader. if the variable is pointing to function or belongs to for example it can be house hunt xyz. overall i think good standards are being followed.
0,the code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. there are some line spacing issues however.
0,yes we can see many pushes on git. hence they have updated code.
0,timely commits and elaborated file.
1,the models views and controllers are well created. you can seed data for the admin into your production environment. the command to do this on hero is hero run rails db seed. you need to make changes in the db file and add your admin credentials in the proper format in this file.
1,everything seems good. you can move constants to separate file and use them. for example where you are comparing admin or reactor you can either move them to separate file or in database and use it.
0,the code is clear and concise it does follow good ruby and rails coding practices.
0,yes the code does follow ruby and rails practices to an extent as i can see the use of many helper methods in the code.
1,stress is given to mac architecture. but proper comments in the code section can simplify the code understanding for other users.
0,the bulk of the code i deciphered was auto generated via scaffold but the code that is changed follows good practices.
0,most files seem to be following good ruby and rails practices.
0,did good job using forms to stay dry with the edit and new pages. some more comments especially in the models would have been helpful to understand why certain validations were chosen. the use of son to store and recall in views was clever.
0,this application has the layout expected of rails application. however not enough information was included in the file about installation.
0,yes. it is well written and they managed to follow dry principle.
0,code follows the basic crud structure given by rails and neatly explains what is being performed. the notices nicely explains the user what is happening. the db schema is designed to incorporate most of the requirements.
0,reviewed the git code for all controller models and views. standard ruby coding practices have been followed and code is easily readable
0,not much of coding is done. only the files automatically created by rails are present.
0,code follows good ruby and rails coding practices. naming conventions are correct methods in controllers are short and concise and there are no instances of spaghetti code.
0,most of the code is well organized and follows good ruby and rails coding practices. but i found some code has indentation problems. for example in session controller line have obvious indentation problem.
1,the ui for the login page is the only thing that loads as i unable to sign up. a suggestion for the future would be to provide username and password for an account that is already created to be provided somewhere to ensure reviewer can log in even if signing up does not work.
0,the file is still the default provided by rails. i don have access to an admin login and when i try to sign up for new account reactor or hunter i get redirected to seepage telling me that something went wrong. the small amount of the ui that does exist login and create account seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in i cannon see any other links.
0,yes user interface is easy to use on the first page.
0, file has no details on how to login and the sign pages for house hunter and are not working. so no way of navigating the application fully.
0, file does details on setting up account for admin. i tried signing up new user for reactor and house hunter whenever i try to sign up it is throwing error. it could be an issue with hero however login prompt is designed very well.
0, file does have any information. not able to login with admin credentials.
0,could not test ui because links for signing up are broken.
0,although the application is deployed on hero and the user interface is concise and easy to use the file provides no information about admin account email and password and application features.
1,im unable to sign as house hunter or reactor so the controllers for the same have not been tested. a suggestion would be to provide details of already created users so that reviewers can log in and test other 
0,due to the lack of provided admin login and the fact that i cannon sign up for reactor or hunter account it is impossible to evaluate the 
0,while the typical rails files for testing were included i did not see complete set of tests for model and controller.
0,i am not able to sign up into the system. neither could see any credentials in the file. hence not able to proceed further to check the above mentioned 
0,default tests are present. not the actual tests.
0,no work has been done. application throws error as soon click on sign up button and choose any type of account.
0,tests are added for most controllers.
0,multiple commits are present in the repo.
0,all of the commits for this application were made on the same day.
0,there were commits on the day it was due presumably to get the project up and running for submission and today to unload the development database.
0,i see commits only on single day.
0,all the changes are pushed at once.
0,git was not utilized fully. there are only handful of commits that do not capture the development process of project.
0,i looked through their commits log and found that their first commit is on oct. maybe their just began to do the project on oct.
1,yes. i am able to login into the system via the link provided.
1,the user interface has bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall. the inquiries list is hard to find for the admin and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the ux. the inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation particularly for the reactor this is also awkward for the house hunter. only one link is needed up top.
0,sign up for and admin gives application error.
0,the user interface is pretty intuitive. few things like the create house functionality is breaking on hero and giving an application error.
1,they have attached other files saying what all they have implemented.
0,everything was described properly in the file.
1,ui is simple to follow. enhancements mentioned below can simplify various tasks. preferred contact method can be drop down with text mail phone options. user role can be drop down with buyer and reactor
1,the user interface is average. the good parts i found about ui are. error messages while registering new admin house hunter reactor house company were helpful. front end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly. for companies while registering houses for houses while submitting etc are properly implemented and easy to use. however several very small changes would make the ui much better. allow drop down when signing up as roles. add inquire house or add new house to interest list etc at the top. if house list gets few hundred rows long user must scroll all the way down to access the add message as to why login failed. something as simple as invalid credentials would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect.
0,no model tests were found but controller test was well tested.
0,i could see testing done. i could see extra test cases added.
1,i feel the user model is well tested. the link to houses broke through reactor role on hero this might just be production issue and might work well locally in the development environment. i recommend checking the hero logs and fixing this error. due to this error i could not create any house for listing. overall i feel it is good job and you have managed to implement most of the one suggestion would be when i try to sign up as user i have to fill up the role type. this is not intuitive for user as the user does not know what kinds of roles and their format case sensitivity data type etc expected by your system. i would suggest either give drop down for this or which will be easy for user to use.
0,you haven completed this task.
0,yes
0,parts of the code is tested partially none of the models are tested thoroughly
0,all the tests are auto generated.
0,the team all had multiple commits throughout the course of the project.
0,yes could see multiple pushes.
0,the team has been pushing changes since around days ago and the project structure feels well planned with some changes and testing required.
0,they have commits. ui is great everything is running smoothly.
0,the project was continuously updated during the past two weeks.
1,git shows too many changes which are not required. one can test thoroughly before submitting the changes.
0,code commit frequency is fairly good.
0,well tested.
0,well written code following coding practices.
0,ruby coding convention has been followed almost throughout the project.
0,all practices were followed
0,code looks good. use comments wherever necessary.
0,the code is well formatted and follows good ruby and rails practice. except for few missing i found the logic very neat.
0,coding standards are fairly good.
0,not defined in file.
0,basic functionality and navigation is missing in the project.
1,intuitive ui. could add bit of bootstrap and cos
0,the admin login id and password provided in the won let me log in to the admin account. hence could test the admin profile information.
0,not thoroughly tested
0,the application is breaking on clicking on the basic such as show or edit. in users show showing home henry design app views users where line raised undefined method reactor for nil extracted source around line current you are registered as reactor please visit your reactor home page here link to reactor home page home reactor path current end
0,model and controller testing are remaining.
0,only the controller part is covered.
0,a model has been thoroughly tested.
0,nothing tested
0,constant changes were being made.
0,yes there are commits done over span of days.
0,team was proactive in working together.
0,the phone number if exceeded digits the code breaks without giving any user friendly alert.
0,the code seems to have followed standard practices. but there is not lot of code to begin with
0,code follows general ruby guidelines and is formatted in legible manner.
0,the ruby code is precise and the project follows proper structure with all the required files.
1,code is great usage of and shows deep understanding of rails as framework. great job. but i find following missing. in controllers you will need to put before action authenticate user. usage of devise for user management is good. code for models seems to be missing house has no entries validations relations etc. you can use rails admin for admin account management. gentile has ref to quite is not deployed on hero integration tests have been written which is good.
0,no deployed.
0,the link for deployed project has not been provided so cannon test any at the codes very little has been implemented. file that has been provided is of no help
1,the application been deployed or they forgot to submit the deployed link.
0,could check as no deployed app link was given
1,there is no external link provided to the application.
1,no link to the deployed app has been provided neither in nor in hence unable to test
1, file is empty..
0,no not even one model or controller has been thoroughly tested
0,yes the team has included tests for controller model and have also implemented integration tests.
0,unable to test
0,there are commits in all. not lot changes have been pushed throughout the project period
0,yes their commits started from september. they have been working on the project for the entire period.
0,there is no external link provided to the application
0, commits in last days implies have been pushing code frequently
1,very inconvenient for me to review without deployed version.
0,when the project was assigned the team didn made much commits. but after week and half they started committing on regular basis. the frequency of commits was then linear which is good thing. the project didn seem to have been completed hurriedly or at the last moment.
0, the repo has many commits contributed by the teammates throughout the project period
0,i found many commits throughout the project period about fixing bugs add new features and update 
1,the user interface is very well designed and the cleanest and the most user friendly among all that i ve reviewed till now. the ui is very intuitive and the alternate shading of the lists improves legibility lot. the only place where the ui was deficient was that it didn seem consistent. the login sign page had different ui compared to other pages. i suppose improving consistency would increase user friendliness of the application to lot of extent.
0,user interface is very nice and well organized.
0,read has all important required details.
0,once any user signs in he she cannon log out. this is major flaw in the workflow
0,this application is deployed on hero and the user interface is easy to understand and use.
0,they team has successfully followed most of the conventions of good programming principles of ruby. the schema was very detailed and cohesive and the variables were named appropriately and effectively. the provided was helpful but the project lacked in program documentation comments which made me to go through each line of code to make sense out of the code. apart from that the practices seemed good.
0, the code is neat and concise with required comments and messages for all the changes
0,models search line don need to use return. controllers home controller line you should use one line to define empty method. controllers house controller line no meaning line break. controllers user controller line no meaning line break.
0,the team seems to have tested the login sign module pretty well. i could hardly find any bugs there. but the team seemed to have ignored testing other modules extensively. this is because the delete functionality in many modules is not working. for example the reactor cannon delete houses or company neither can house hunter delete houses from his interest list.
0, the layout functionality does not work for any user
0,i noticed they did generate tests for some controllers but not enough. no tests for models.
0,the code followed best practices for items such as indentation line separation and method naming.
0,mac structures are very nice and every required functions are finished.
0,very nicely written code. dry principles used nicely. formatting is also done very nicely.
0,code looks as they say hella fresh. very clean from the files i looked over.
0,the team has used excellent ruby standards coding practice. controller as well as model has variable names which are self explanatory.
0,the code on git has good readability with proper indentation and naming conventions. similar have been combined together into class like in the case of the use of single user model and role based authentication has certainly dry up the code. one possible alternative to further dry up the code is that in many controllers like in the case of users controller every method is storing the list of real estate companies in an instance variable real estate companies. so in this case fallback like before action can be used to save the real estate companies in real estate companies variable so that all methods have access to it. the use of appropriate instead of looping constructs like for and while follows ruby good coding practices. every controller serves specific purpose and the use of common welcome controller and its associated views has again modularised the code for easy extensibility
0,ruby rails code standards are correctly followed. and code is committed properly.
1,the user interface is very intuitive. i like the modern look and feel of the ui as well as the icons and images. it quite professional. excellent work. the various buttons are in good locations. the button text could be darker however. the new user link could be made into bigger button which would make it more prominent. right now it is hard to see.
0,ui has modified which is good.
0,the interface is very good clean and very easy to use.
0,very nice ui great ux. great use of material design icons and bootstrap. enjoyed using the webster great job.
0,in general ui was great. the site looks really clean and the buttons did what i expected them to do.
0,user interface is well organized and easy to use.
0,highly intuitive user interface. properly states admin as well as new user login. the shows the logged in user as well as log out options. very easy to user and understandable.
0,the user interface is very appealing. the show view is especially remarkable that makes good use of the attractive classes of cos and bootstrap. the navigation links provided in every page are very helpful to explore the webster the switch user capability makes it easy for users to switch between roles without the hassle of logging out and logging in again. one issue that i encountered was that the inquiries controller has not been fully implemented which lands the webster into an error page.
0,yes the ui is interactive and easy to use.
0,the testing was thorough although one model and one controller individually did not appear to be tested thoroughly.
0,modules have test cases.
0,yes at least one controller and one model have been tested.
0,some test cases are missing for complicated flows like real estate company should only be deleted when there are no assigned.
0,the inquiry controller was thoroughly tested but none of the models appear to have the same amount of testing.
0,two tests have been implemented and working.
1,the team has not yet started to test their models unit test and controller functional and integration test. test driven development add is good strategy to test the application features before and during the application development phase. by using add it is possible to anticipate the potential pit falls and corner cases before starting to address the code to tackle those.
0,hunters are working properly.
0,the team used multiple development branches and master branch along with frequent commits to stay in sync.
0,
0,yes the team keep on pushing their changes.
0,yes there are periodic commits and the messages are very descriptive.
0,starting on september nd and going up through today. commits is great.
0,a total of commits. consecutive update done on 
0,the team has started to work on the project from sept th and has regularly pushed their commits to the repository. both the team members have been actively contributing to the project. a total of commits have been made so far and the project is progressing at very good rate.
0,i could see commits made my team members in timely manner.
0,code is written properly and followed ruby framework with mac architecture also added various packages.
0,basic practices were followed reliability of code is maintained and the code is well intended
1,lot of work is done good job. few suggestions from my end tests not implemented for both model and controller i do see box role ids multiple true checked role role role false but roles are not visible in ui though images are unloaded in house profile it is not displayed also as i understand multiple images for house are allowed hence its incorrect to use has one attached image path. validations for models such house are missing its good coding tech to add in controllers in ui it is good to add in tables so that all fields are aligned you have before action authenticate user. but in the controller tests i do not see login as part the tests.
1,the team has followed good coding practices with sufficient priority on mac model. each model controller view has specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code. i am giving because. the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code. dry concept can be used to better extent.
0,it has good structure choice of names of the files is appropriate and readable
0,the pre configured admin details are not mentioned on git. therefore i am unable to test admin
0,user interface is nice. team has tried keeping the ui as per standards and easy to access to user. they have also added validation. team could give more clear and understandable errors.
0,no credentials for admin available in the can access the admin section and hence cannon grade it. also no roles have been defined in the sign form. hence cannon identify general user as an admin reactor hunter. hence unable to review the access control methods of the project.
0, nameless everglades users sign up does not let you enter roles which then fails the user sign no details of admin given tried logging for companies and got an error nameless everglades companies with some combinations was able to login but then again when tried updating account got error error prohibited this user from being saved i suspect that is because role field does not have value list of users being showed for creating new house issues in sending messages tried sending message got error nameless everglades messages
0,the ui looks appealing and very easy to follow. the choice of layout properly differentiates various class of possible with the application. yet the ui lacks the below aspects. there is no concept of user role in the sign form. though there is role field it always shows empty. few links in the layout are broken. few fields like the phone number can be made optional for creating users which eases the process.
0,i could not find admin credentials in read me file rest of the interface is good
0,sign up for roles not available admin credentials not provided can not sign up as reactor hunter from ui. hence can not verify any of the can not find search feature. file is not informative. too short.
0,the interface is well designed and has good ui but the basic are breaking. unable to login as hunter admin and can perform their respective operations. i assume the default user is the reactor as after login i can only post add new house.
0,i am unable to sign up. i am getting the following error we re sorry but something went wrong. if you are the application owner check the logs for more information. therefore i am unable to test any of the features.
0,they have tested initial testing but functional testing of is not done. once we log in we do not understand which user is it. reactor house hunter.
0,no
0,the team has tested parts of different models but none of the models is thoroughly tested for functional verification.
0,i could not see the list of test cases
0,reactor user can perform basic 
1,please submit the with pre configured users. as i am unable to test anything.
0,yes. we could see updated git. hence can conclude that they are updating code regularly.
0,somewhat. since i can see the commits were made in days only
0,there were commits in days which means that they have been working in last few days and have been doing check in regularly since they started work.
1,the team has effectively worked on multiple commits yet these suggestions need to be followed suggestions. commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. so this has to explain the changes to decent extent. commit messages in this repository is vague if they are meaningful it reduces some effort in analysing the code 
0, i can see commits which is descent
0,git has been used properly but needed team contribution. there is only one committee
1,unfortunately i am unable to view this git repository. this is most likely due to the fact that the repo is set to private and only available to those currently collaborating. i would suggest making the setting adjustment for the repo to be public so reviewers and ta can grade the work that has been completed. when coding take note of the stylistic norms of ruby regarding method calls parenthesis and syntax best practices. additionally maintain consistent intention scheme for ease of review.
0, link above gives error. please fix it.
1, link is not redirecting. shows not found. please deploy the application on any of the platforms.
0,no link available as their page itself in not working by showing it is not available.
0, link is broken and the project has not been deployed. don know how to review this project.
0,the git link provided redirected me to page saying not found. since there in any links of the deployed project could not test it.
0,the project is not working at all.
1,there was no link included to allow reviewer access to the deployed application. when you are finally able to submit the appropriate working link i would suggest having that contains the suggested ruby content along with the information encouraged by the project write up. additionally i would suggest having person not participating in the course to take look at your application. he she may be able to offer way to gauge the ease and effectiveness of your site. they may also offer valuable insight into feature placement and page flow.
0,their link is unavailable and non functional. they don seem to have unloaded on hero app.
1,the git may very well contain the appropriate testing files however i am unable to view the due to the privacy settings of the repository. i would suggest that your try and test those models controllers that have the most complexity to increase the level of confidence in your product. make sure to test the validations and boundary cases thoroughly especially model attributes that have restrictions on things such as length and type. there are also several instances in the project where various users can accomplish the same tasks but with slight differences. it will be to your benefit to pay close attention in creating tests that can replicate these tasks.
0,their link is unavailable and non functional. they don seem to have unloaded on hero app.
0,the git link is not correct. also the project is not deployed.
1,unable to view the git repository. git is truly your friend during development. make habit of really committing with useful commit messages and at appropriate feature development times. my team and i found that having different commits for each feature implementation gave many options for points in time that we could revert back to in the invent that something went awry.
1,you are following good ruby coding practices. for some places where you are comparing for example in login controller if login email admin admin login password admin you can use constant file where you can write these admin and use that constant. its not good practice to write it like this. otherwise everything seems good.
0,the code is as per coding practices. nice first attempt.
0,well structured code using mac pattern. could find admin credentials mentioned on 
0,looks good to me. the ruby dry code approach is followed throughout.
0,the code repository is concise and well maintained. the code base follows goo ruby and rails coding practices. the mac architecture skeleton is implemented in an elegant manner. the desired features need to be implemented and the security issues need to be fixed.
0,ruby way of writing some condition is unless condition couple of large if else structures that could be broken down.
0,easy to understand.
0,the back button is loop. i can never traverse back to dashboard
0,user view is easy to understand and navigate. there are certain links which don work and does load any page.
0,yes it is very intuitive and easy to use.
0,test cases are generated through scaffold.
0,i am unable to go back to dashboard. hence i am unable to test the of house hunter. the back button is major problem.
0,only controller tested
0,not all are working but the once which are working are end to end tested and works fine. there are few changes which are required cannon create an inquiry cannon check the potential buyers cannon list house cannon search house
0,the team has not implemented testing module as of yet.
0,you are not testing anywhere yet.
0,test skeletons are present. does look like tests are added yet.
0,committed throughout the period to avoid merge conflicts.
0,the have been implemented but the back button is major problem
0,yes timely pushing of code and creation of branches to avoid merge conflict
0,the team has well documented history of commits for the code repository
0,you guys started pretty late. but overall great effort. great ui.
1,yes the code was written well but lot of related to the session was not added.
1,overall the following things can be improved the primary key for the real estate company should be auto generated. this is done automatically by the rails framework so maybe you can remove the code from the view which asks for the user to select the primary key while creating company. whenever there is reference to foreign key in model you can validate and use that reference by following the format model id where model is the entity of your foreign key. eg. if house has foreign key of reactor reactor is the entity of your foreign key hence you can reference the reactor as reactor id in your house model. this is because rails follows convention over configuration and this is the naming convention with respect to foreign keys.
0,good coding style.
0,navigation between pages is not defined well.
0,login page is not available. also back navigation from any page is not present. very difficult for user to come back to the last page visited.
0,the user interface is very primitive the team could have done much more. they have not designed it very well. although i was not looking for graphics but the element placement could have been much more improved.
1,the user interface is done as it would be in basic ruby application which is good. there is no login functionality this is mentioned in the which was helpful. some which could be improved are when i try to add new house hunter from admin i get contact method is not included in the list error. as user i don know what kind of values your system is expecting in this field so it might help to probably provide selection element and put in your values there. in this way the user will always select value which your system is expecting. if there are finite number of values you can just hard code them into the element else pick it up from the db and populate your as such. when i click on back from the new i am directed to show all house hunters . you could improve this by updating the link to for this back button by providing it with the user or you could detect which is the current user logged in reactor house hunter admin and accordingly redirect to that role home page .
1,the login page is not made. all the information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed. it was difficult to understand if i was under the admin page reactor or hunter page.
0,deployed on hero interface is not friendly but thr file explained some of it.
0,decent coding practice
0,the app indentation method names and line separation seem to match solid ruby style guidelines.
0,from what i see it seems to be following the practice we have been using in class
0, yes the source code follows expected for style. the directory names and project structure also follow for conventions. good job.
1,the code base is very well written and commented. the code has been done with good coding practices. the only point to note would be to update the to be more informative.
0,good rails coding practice has been implemented. in model as well controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model.
1,the user interface is nice. i suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. also yes and no would probably be more user friendly than true and false for the basement condition. the new user window was very intuitive and powerful. note i found bug in this window changing the admin account with reactor checked causes an error. the error screen was graceful however. also please use radio buttons for hunter or reactor not please also include the type of the user in the users window.
1,the ui is quite good but the design can be improved. the application allows reactor to add company details while signing up which does not make for great design. without authentication no user should be allowed to perform any functionality.
0,no cos has been applied. links are redirecting to pages instead of just performing the action
0, the links tell you what page you will go to or what action you will do. it not pretty but it works enough
1, ui is easy to use but not well described in the please add brief test cases to demonstrate expected functionality.
1,the interface is basic and no extra styling is done. but overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. the read me file of the repo should be updated to make it more detailed to use.
0,the interface is intuitive. specially they have very good form structure for reactor as well as new users and house hunters.
0,it appears minimal controller testing has been performed.
0,no tests have been written for the application
0,no testing but at least they mentioned it in the 
0,no testing module found.
0,the team used multiple branches and many commits throughout the project to increment on the 
1,while the team did push changes to the project there are commits which are unnecessary. instead of pushing every change to the final project the team could have combined few of the changes and pushed them all at once to make for better record of the changes made.
1,teams looks fairly active but the project progress does not correspond to the number of commits made in the git repository
0, they have lot of commits so they were always working on it
0,yes it looks like sizable commits were made before the th.
0,yes commits.
0,testing has not been done for any model or controller yet
0,no they have not. they said they will for the final submission
0,all commits happened at deployment.
0,the interface is good and the provides good documentation.
0,some of the controllers have tests
0,could find any issues respective to style guidelines
1,the user interface was working as described in the file. the ui functionality don have any issues apart from the one noted in additional comments if team would have given some assets config the ui would have been great on the looks as well
0,did not see spec folder in the git
0,there were commits overall in the git
0,the code follows the good coding practices. however there are some instances where i found commented lines of code in the controller. ex. house hunters controller lines and users controller function switch role
0,the user interface is quite intuitive to use. i had very minor suggestion. i found case where the go back link was missing and thus i had to click on the dashboard link to go back. ex. after i click on view companies there no go back link. overall i feel you did really good job. for example while switching the role you gave an option to edit the roles as well. as well as delete account functionality.
0,companies controller along with few other controllers are populated with the tests generated by scaffolding. no tests in models found.
0,all commits were found to be done on single day. i.e. october.
1,the team has proper concern on mac model. each model controller view has specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code. still i am giving because. the project has neglected dry principle in many of the instances. this has resulted in bulkier code. as many authors say code looks good if it appears like reading novel. this appearance of novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user attention. the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code.
1,the file is developed to include all the necessary details about the project as whole. great work on documenting. the ui is simple with properly designed tabs. few enhancements could include. the back button is missing in few places which might be useful for easier navigation. while creating company if size is modelled as drop down to take range of values then ui would be simpler.
0,the team has tested parts of different models but none of the models is thoroughly tested for functionality verification.
1,i can see that there are multiple commits on single day. this might imply that team members have worked remotely without using git. suggestions. make complete use of git when working remotely. keep pushing changes periodically to avoid any code loss and to have of changes. commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. so this has to explain the changes to decent extent. commit messages in this repository is vague if they are meaningful it reduces some effort in analysing the code .
0,very nice code and almost every functions that test required are finished.
0,the interface is easy to use and it is all described in the file.
0,the test for controller and model has been done. and all the details have been included into the file.
0,good set of directions in 
0,most of it default ui provided by rails but is easy to use.
0,basic functionality seems to be working. but no explicit test cases found.
0,there were continuous code pushes.
0,you guys started pretty late seeing from your commit history.
0,most of the commits were early this week.
0,well done work except the lack of search the file and the ui is not so good anyway it a good work.
0,only basic validations have been implemented. tests generated through scaffold are available.
1,testing for controllers has been completed. unfortunately test cases for models were not worked on. a suggestion could be to test validation of inquiry if corresponding reactor or house hunter gets deleted.
0,you haven implemented testing yet. i didn find anything in test files. probably you ll do it in the next phase.
0,house hunter are checked but there is scope for improvement
0,multiple controllers are thoroughly tested but no models appear to be properly tested.
0,could not find commits for test files.
0,several of the required are available though many links are not working.
1,links to create new are all in place and working perfectly. however i would like to suggest the overall redirection of the user to various places in the app would greatly improve user experience as using the back button again and again in the browser tends to become irritating after while.
0,its deployed on hero but haven written about what all features you have completed and what all features are left to complete. also there are few pages where you can add link to go to main menu. sometimes i have to go back times to reach main menu.
0,the user interface is very confusing. it is difficult to get to the sign up page to begin with and then the messages and are cryptic to actual users anyone other than computer scientists. it is very difficult to follow where the links take you on the webster and what exactly you are looking at at any given moment.
1,you are following good coding practice. i have suggestion that you can move admin and house hunters as childs of user. that is admin belongs to user reactor belongs to user etc. currently you have all the information in user model.
0,while the code is organized well and seems to follow the model view controller design pattern the project does seem to make good use of the relational database. there are multiple models controllers specifically the list of potential buyers that are not necessary at all because of the relational database.
0,ui is fine but cannon access file
1,comments and indentation at couple of places can be update.
0,house hunter accounts controller line meaningless line break. house list controller line meaningless line break. reactor accounts controller line meaningless line break. session controller line wrong indentations line no parentheses. user controller line meaningless line break line no parentheses.
0,have used dry principles. follows good coding practices.
0,yes the ui is good and easy for navigation usage.
0, needs to be updated. ui looks good but ux can be worked upon.
1,application is deployed on hero but the user interface does not compliant with the requirement your home page contains house information and search function before user signing in. also it is not described in the file.
0,the ui is good and intuitive. good use of colors and features.
0,yes tests are done for many models and controllers.
0,test skeleton present. however tests can be made in depth.
1,basic tests are written. could improve by adding specific application logic.
0,yes there are lot of commits over many days from multiple contributors
0,yes there are many commits which added new features and fixed some bugs.
0,yeah they have done the project with even number of commits throughout the duration.
0,the link provided is not working. so no way of finding out
0,ui is easy to understand but problematic to use. admin must use user ids to create hunters or or inquiries and the display is via user ids too. sign page redirect to show all signed up users. from there any one who is not logged in can delete users. same user can be added as house hunter any number of times with separate entries. no validations are added i can choose role no. for sign and no error messages have been provided. passwords are in plain text. in some cases wrong notices are displayed create user with wrong info gives user account was successfully created. aaa. which is incorrect as user was not actually created. back to your page links do not work
0,there is no code apart from basic scaffold generated. commit id reviewed fe beach f e cc c
0,the database schema only consisted of the users table and the crud on the mac related to it. due to the less amount of content to review proper justification for this question is bit tough. even though the amount of code was less but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails except few. for example he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments. it makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code. but apart from that the practices seemed fine. the variables were named appropriately functions were named effectively and the classes were defined definitely.
0,in you should not write code like this by id session user name
0,the code follows mac architecture and practices in an organized way
0,there is not much implementation by the team hence i cannon comment much on it
1,only user model in app models rest of the models such as house reactor real estate company are missing same with controllers. in user model could add validation for email format i would suggest user gem devise for user management and rails admin for admin functionality. this helps as the gems taking control of implementation and the developers can concentrate on business logic if back is clicks on user edit the user is logged out instead of going to profile page
1,as this project is in the early stages of development the ui is minimal. the title is prominently displayed as header on the home page and subsequent pages to clearly indicate what this application is real estate manager. the login and sign links are clear as to purpose however the intent in the presence of the words hello world beside them is unclear. additionally the login and sign page are easily interpreted. i would suggest that the user profile actually display what kind of user they are rather than number that only has meaning to the system as well as log out link button in the header for user as he she traversed your application. the file only contains the fact that there is no pre configured administrator. i would recommend including the suggested context from the ruby generator and the project write up.
0,the interface was very easy and simple to use and was very user friendly but it lacked intuitiveness on some levels. also the file didn state anything about the ui.
0,apart from the login functionality nothing is done. commit id fe beach f e cc c
0,for sign up i don understand what is the difference between i am shopping for house and i am reactor and i am shopping for house.
0,the file in as descriptive as it should be. and ui is not very well designed. printing hello world on the home page seems to be debugging strategy but it needs to be removed. and proper links needs to be inserted. example link of layout is not present
0,only user reactor login has been implemented yet. other functionality is missing. stated that admin has not been configured.
0,the user interface looks intuitive as it has options for signing up with different roles
1,the ui is simple however because of the lack of functionality cannon be assessed properly. one suggestion would be to rename the label of back button to layout to make it more intuitive.
0,no tests have been written
0,no i don think they have submitted any test model.
0,they have tested for the models and controllers constructed.
0,no all tests are missing
0,i could find any test method other than the one in the sessions controller test class.
1,the code follows ruby and rails convention but there are multiple commented files in the project such as and many more which have not been used in the application.
0,seem to be following standard practices.
1,the database schema especially for the login sign functionality is very well implemented and includes lots of features that were asked for at the first place. so the extra hard work is very well appreciated. the db design is very cohesive and seems fool proof. the rest of the programs and the follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices. but the one thing i find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code. given the short time frame not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable but there were certain points where i had to go through the whole code to realize what happening which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code.
0,yes the code has the parameters well defined for all the users and has the correct mac layout as expected. for instance they seem to have created separate mac architectures for houses inquiries interests companies and users. this goes to show that they have layered approach on access and privileges. also the code is written in very clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self explanatory of the they perform.
1,the team has followed good ruby coding practices. all the code is neatly written and well indented. however the code has no comments.
1,the user interface lack multiple navigation such as it does have any cancel or back button. so if user tries to move back or cancel while creating company he would be stuck and would not be able to move to any other tab.
0,good job done here. you have listed the features available to test.
0,admin credentials in file not working therefore not able to test admin part. ui is confusing there are multiple success messages displayed. only ids are displayed in house list and no other info
1,the user interface looks pretty is clean and intuitive. but the placement of menu buttons was rather not obvious. it took time for me to figure out login sign buttons and i also had to actively look for buttons to perform actions after signing in which in actually much user friendly. though it may seemed cliche but i think it is very user friendly to have action buttons on the content of the web page rather than having them at the top inside the header. but apart from that the simplicity and the look and feel was pretty good.
1,it is surely very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit. even so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there are any blanks at all. so we get easily confused on what to do. sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or reactor and we don know what to do. luckily the file does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps.
0,the app is deployed very well and is very easy to use.
0,all the basic features implemented for admin house hunter and reactor is functional.
0,no testing portion of the code seems empty. no testing has been done
1,the login sign module has lots of bugs. like when user tries to create an account with an already existing username the application crashes. also user cannon sign as both reactor and moreover there any validation for the length of phone number nor the validation for the email address is correct. for example it accepts aa as valid email address. so yes these in the login sign module could be improved and these does not seem thoroughly tested. but the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well and as expected.
1,well we can say that they have indeed tested the models they have defined in their file on the definitions of the in the db folders and the controllers folder makes it very easy to follow how they have structured the code. also the way the houses are added the redirection the houses to the links such as and webster is very intuitive and well thought out and thus barring out few minor mistakes in linking and page definitions the code has good ability to run for the defined cases specially for the admin to be failsafe. only one complaint though the whole structure does crumble when one sees that they have allowed the admin to be deleted. this is their biggest loophole.
0,although code exists there are no written
0,there are commits made during the tenure of the project by all the team members. the team has worked on git since the start of the project.
0,yes commits. it seems they have been pushing changes regularly
0,yes the commits were regular. after the project was assigned there were several commits on weekly basis and as the deadline neared the frequency of the commits kept increasing in an orderly manner. there was no last minute rush and the development of the project seemed pretty well planned.
0,yes as seen from the number of commits on each section of their profile not only have they meticulously made number of changes on repo but they have also updated what all changes they made against the files. this is very neat practice in my opinion and shows that they have put ample effort to structure the code. moreover they have updates the gentile multiple times so as to make it run for the hero app which is must thing to do and challenge we faced too.
0,yes there are git commits and pushes after initial commit as well.
0,while the application has similar layout as typical rails application i noticed there were no migrations in the db. also the was not formatted very well and didn tell me much about how to install the project locally.
0,the code seems to be following the examples in cookbook app.
0,the code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices. however i can see no migrations in the db folder. the file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct.
0, the source code and project structure seems fine but most of it still looks scaffold generated. for conventions have been maintained.
0,yes. timely commits with comments.
0,the code written was clear and i believe that it follows good ruby and rails coding practices to certain extent.
0,it is done well and i can say it is indeed good ruby and rails coding practice
0,i was not provided link so i cannon see if the ui is intuitive.
0,the webster is not up yet. i looked through the code. looks like there are still some not implemented.
1,unfortunately the app has not been deployed on cloud platform and neither is there any description in the file. i suggest to use hero as your deployment platform. you may want to look into this video here watch feature also if you deploy in hero it does not support quite or myself in production. hence you will need to migrate your db to check out this link for help articles quite
0,if it is deployed it is not made known.
0,please provide the link to the deployed webster
1,the link to the deployed application was not posted and file does not have the required information such as admin login details or how to access various features in the application.
0,i do not see the link in the file for the deployment in the cloud
0,i dd not find the link. i viewed the code on it seems work.
0,while there are some tests for controllers they were only the auto created tests by rails. there were test files for the models but not test cases present.
1,controllers have few test cases models have none. some of the suggested test cases could be as follows company test company should not be deleted if not owner of company reactor should only be able to delete company if he created it
0, only scaffold generated tests for models and controllers.
0,yes
0,no test cases found in the test folder
0,i have seen they keep updating the 
0,there were changes pushed to the branch throughout the project period.
0, no the initial commits were made the thursday before the st submission was do. it is great to see additional commits since the st submission.
0,the first commit for the project was made only days before the deadline. since then the team kept continuously pushing their changes.
0,i can see commits with good distribution over the time span.
0,git link is not working. the account might be private
0,the code follows common ruby rails guidelines
0,it has not been thoroughly tested. user house and company models don have enough validations like valid year phone no should be only company while creating user does link that company to the user. it has to be done manually later
1,there are some indentation issues but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable. also ids should not be on the ui. the house hunters and should not have to sign in after signing up.
0,there are lot of not so important comments in the controllers. and lot of dry code
0,this team has done good job of following rails conventions. there are db migrations common layouts of the application structure and proper use of helpers.
0,the code seems very good. and the code is very clearly.
0,the git code did follow the good coding practices using ruby and rails.
0,all files they provided are clearly structured especially for the routes file. they provide clear routes for different conditions.
1,the user interface has very basic look and feel. the sign up links being on every page is not ideal. there should only be log out link. also the company in the reactor page is showing the id not the company name. i suggest you use drop down menu for the preferred contact of the house hunter who is signing up. it would be much more intuitive to have single sign in page for all users. there were also missing back buttons.
0,yes. the ui is easy to use. but the dashboard could be made better. as every task is written on the same line
0,while links and navigation were generally easy to find several links rendered broken pages and several got stuck in loop asking me to log in as an admin to edit user when i was already logged in.
0,for all user sign up and log in should at the same place.
0,the ui had good directives between operations and was easy to use. the admin profile was available in the file.
0,the file is blank so i cannon get access to the admin functions. the user interface is clear but not so well structured. for example the title appears after the different choices. and all the choices are list in single line.
1,while thorough controller test exists there is no model test.
1,the admin model performed mostly all the required specifications. the reactor and house hunter models could be made better.
1,yes there were some improvements that i noticed while testing the site features in the review duration which included modifications to view list of all houses created by company of which reactor is part. the program has scope for minimal improvements to make it function as needed.
1,of the functionality the team have tried to to implement the code quality is not poor. however the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all seem to have been implemented. the def after sign in path for function in the applications controller used by the devise gem only takes reactor as resource i would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. also i was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to real estate company be visible to reactor and similarly only the inquiries posted by house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. i would again suggest using some if or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current user.
1,company could have been just company
0,yes it is.
0,code seems to follow the ruby practices.
0,lot of unnecessary directories are created in controller
0,code is written in clean and readable way. there are separate methods for separate tasks. good naming convention is followed throughout the project.
1,the code is clean and readable. every method handles only one task. however there are two controllers for house hunters and which i felt was redundant. these could have been merged and written in single controller. there is no bad naming in the project they have followed the naming conventions. there are no long methods. methods have been written concisely and in readable way.
0,the team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. they have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user it seems that they created new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration sessions.
0,yes they have keep commit to git as their project been working.
0,fewer commits on the project more towards the deadline date.
0,most of the commits are within the last days before submission of project. yes commits for round are provided properly.
0,the team submitted their changes towards the end of the project. they committed changes in round.
1,though the commits started late in the project life there were commits frequently and also after round. the commit messages could have been little more descriptive to fully comprehend the commit changes.
1,the belongs to and has many conditions have been set by the team on the model files. but there are no foreign indexes on schema file. i would advise using model id index with scaffold generate to add foreign key and in case of devise generated tables i suggest creating foreign key with new migration. here a link that shows how to do that questions adding foreign key to rails model
0,yes there is has many relationship in company model and also reactor is able to create multiple house in one company.
1,from the code db design looks fine. they have handled most of the relationships properly. although i believe having different tables for hunters users roles and role maps is un necessary and just increases the complexity of the system.
0,the relationship between house hunter reactor and companies have been well established.
0,the was deployment attempted by the team does not work. i attempted to clone the repository and run it locally but was unable to. looking at the code itself i was able to determine that the replying to an inquiry are missing. i am unsure why the team opted use the devise model generator for the companies model. the companies are a type of user on this project from my understanding and rather resource. would it be possible for the team to use scaffold generate instead.
0,they got pretty much every basic functions in the app. but i am not sure where should i login as an admin. and there are some small bugs. there will display two layout button after you login as hunter. back does not work well.
0,i cannon access the link provided by the team. since this is hosted on was i believe they have not opened the ip to public by mistake i have worked with was before and this happens. maybe they worked from library or their house and when you spawn an instance in was it adds the ip from where the instance is spawned to the access list which is why i am not able to access this from my ip. this can also be problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code the default request will go to port and wont be forwarded to unless explicitly specified in apache nine and will block the requests. easier way would be to host the app on hero which handles all this automatically and provides you with dns entry
0,the link submitted is not live. as result i could not test if the system is working as it is supposed to.
0,the given link does not work and gives the following error this site can be reached.. refused to connect. hence cannon comment on the 
0,the app provided didn work
0,the overall system works as it is supposed however there are few functions which are not implemented. page validations for phone number have not been written because phone number of length less than is getting accepted by the system during sign up of reactor houses does not start from under the your houses section in the page. your houses delete house option is not provided under the palette functionality to change from reactor to house hunter and vice versa is not to edit or delete company under the page is not implemented. house hunters page house hunter should not be able to update and create new houses but these links are provided under the house hunter page. although the functionality of update and create new house has not been implemented. it gives out the following error messages. error messages in houses show showing home odd app views houses where line raised no route matches action show controller id nil missing required keys id in new undefined method houses for nil 
0,since i was unable to run the code on my local device i am unable to test for edge cases. however i would suggest adding destroy dependency in model files for example for house hunters has many inquiries dependent destroy the file fails to provide an information about edge cases.
0,cannon access app
0,edge cases are not handled. but most of the logic will automatically handle edge cases.
0,the given link does not work and gives the following error this site can be reached.. refused to connect. hence cannon comment on the edge cases.
0,there is no link to login as an admin. the site went down so could not test further this site can be reached.. refused to connect. search for house hunters sign err connection refused
0,no model tests have been implemented. basic controller tests generated by scaffold and devise are available.
0,yes they have tested lot. like admin house and inquiries.
0,testing has been done for users controller and model.
0,yes the team has tested model and controller.
0,some controllers are tested. models are not tested thoroughly.
0,dont see sec folder
1,the test scripts have been written however the scripts could have been written in more elaborate way to include all the test cases and not just the high level tests. for example the system accepts an invalid phone number which is less than digits of length. all these test cases could have been written and tested
0,code is well written and organised. all the functions have been objectively defined and does only what it is supposed to do.
1,the code is much clean and readable. all the functions are short and crisp with proper indentation. however mostly they have tried to embed the which could have been separate to be in the basic crud functions provided by rails. for eg. here they haven maintained different function for the potential buyer instead they have used hash for it which is embedded in the show functionality of the house controller
1,all methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. good job. could have named the methods and variables little better. each function performs single task. every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if else conditions.
0,could relate code with the application for eg admin index page has hello admin at the top however there is no such thing on the ui similarly for inquiries list the inquiries not found in ui
0,some methods are bit long and nest quite deep.
0,code looks neat. methods have only one functionality. well organized.
0,the earliest commit is dated around oct.
0,yes they have been committing bit regularly. although the commits contribution are not equally distributed among the team members.
0,the team was regular in committing changes. the team continued to work in round and made regular progress. all members contributed significantly. great job. could have started the project bit earlier.
0,all commits happened during round but work was done before.
0,started committing after round
0,yes the team kept the changes throughout the project and also in round.
0,yes. feedback has been accepted and changes made in round.
0,all the relationships have been properly defined in the models.
0,yes they have properly defined the associations for every table and haven missed on anything.
0,all dependencies are well and designed. every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. your team is pro. reactor to house and house to company other relationships are implemented. each company has multiple and each reactor can have multiple houses. everything good here.
0,by looking at their model files relationships are handled well.
0,db mappings are done well. cascading delete and cascading nullify implemented to handle delete cases.
0,don see the role switch functionality and it not mentioned in the file too. while adding new house by an admin it is seen that i can add it to company say a and and also add reactor r which does not belong in company a but another company say b. so what is the flow here. the end result is the house has company a but has reactor whose company is b.
0,not many problem detected. working to the expectations.
1, pure peak houses when this link is opened after registering as reactor and adding house the application crashes. all other basic functionality works well. great job with the design and methods. the flow of the application could be bit more clear instead of just listing all the links in one page.
0,all functionality seems to be present now.
0,most basic are working. admin functions of add delete users is now working well. one issue that i faced reactor view house listings button not working so most of the reactor as they are dependent on houses are not working.
0,yes the system works fine and authors have fixed the problems found in the first round. for an instance admin functionality and interest functionality were not present in round one but authors have implemented them now.
0,yes most of the issues identified in the round was fixed apart from below admin login while creating account the ui says password as option but am leave them blank reactor view listing is not working as result reactor is not able to see the was able to delete the admin account
0,all feedback has been accepted and changes made to fix them.
1,the view listings page for reactor errors out and does not render when the admin deletes house hunter who is also potential buyer for various houses. the inquiries get deleted though but the application breaks when it comes to handling potential buyers.
1, when the admin deletes real estate company it deletes the house entry but despot deletes the entry however for reactor the company field becomes blank. when the reactor changes his company he is still able to delete and view the companies that he had listed with the previous company. yes the inquires case is handled properly.
0,when the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses all the houses and are deleted as well. this is the expected functionality. good job. all other test cases work as well. if an admin tries to delete house hunter with multiple inquiries all of his her inquiries are deleted as well.
0,all deletion edge cases seem to be accounted for.
0,edge cases handled well. after hunter adds an inquiry the back button goes again to the create new inquiry form letting the user recreate the same inquiry multiple times does not cover how the system handles edge cases.
0,yes all the edge cases are handled very well.
0,not able to log in as admin. incorrect of admin.
0, reactor not able to view the house listing so unable to check if inquiry deletions.
0,the edge cases tested where handled properly with proper messages that shows which other entities will be affected by the change.
0,no they haven tested
1,no testing has been done. i checked the spec folder not present and no changes have been made to the pre built testing files as well. you could have easily written the tests for the user model and controller just by looking at the cookbook application. good job overall with the db validations and checks in the application for login layout
0,tests are good but spec was used for any of them.
0,spec folder is not there. there are just some automatically generated tests in the test folder. model controller testing has not been done.
0,yes the team has thoroughly tested and did validations.
0,tests for controllers look good. need to include more tests for models.
0,code naming convention done well.
1,the code has been implemented as per the ruby standards of coding. however there are few instances of code could be better handled such as the index function in admin controller.
1,overall it good. also in houses controller the logic in the find houses method should have been moved to the corresponding model. application logic should be moved to the model. the controller found in app controllers is empty. what it for. also when it comes to naming house controller and home controller seems confusing.
0, yes no no
0,the application code is properly divided into modules. the controller have defined functions for various tasks. the of interest list potential buyers replies to inquires are missing from the application. class reg is not proper name for the class. also the class is included in the houses controller which is not good programming practice. the developers should have created new controller for the reg class. the validations are missing for company details. also separate sessions are created for different user types.
0,commits performed during the course.
0,all the code of the project has been pushed to on single day.
0,only commits were found. the first commit was dated around oct. no changes were committed in round.
0,no according to the commits record in i think that they seems created new repository to replace the old one and most of changes happened in one day oct. besides i cannon see the sign of team work. in oct one guy the first commit and the other guy submitted some changes in oct which does look like team work. since they replaced the old repository with new repo and didn show much sign of team working i give they one point.
0,didn commit at regular intervals. yes committed changes in round.
0,the git repository was created on oct after the round was completed. the commits were no regular during the complete course of the project. all the commits happened on the day of final submission.
0,handled to and to relationships successfully
0,the team has handled all the associations between multiple entities quite well.
0,the relationships are properly defined.
0,follows the relationships properly.
1,the use of active record is missing from the application. there are no foreign key relationships in the schema. although the relationship are maintained in the model file. a separate database is created for admin reactor hunter which will store lot of redundant data. there is no database for storing the response of inquiries. according to the db design house belongs to both company and reactor directly which is not correct.
0,the basic work successfully.
0,the team has tried implementing lot of as per the code. however the below ones does not work the admin cannon view or delete the inquiries made by house hunter. while trying to layout as an admin the application breaks. the reactor cannon edit the information. while reactor tries to add view houses the application breaks. while trying to view the houses as an admin the application breaks. we re sorry but something went wrong. if you are the application owner check the logs for more information.
0, reactor can sign up without specifying real estate company. this should be the case. reactor can edit his profile after logging in. admin not able to create and house hunters. nothing happens when the submit button is clicked. later this was found out to be because of the phone number not having digits. but no error or validation message was shown. admin can create new houses. reactor after logging in can only create and view houses. no way found to view and reply to inquiries. also no way found to see potential buyers. house hunters can edit houses due to session issues. house search feature breaks. it works only with location. are not able to add new houses. admin can delete real estate company. clicking destroy takes it back to the show page. log out running into errors.
0,limited functionality for admin
1,the system just works in few functions. even though authors fix the problem that admin cannon log in in the first round it still lack many functions that the system supposed to have. from the admin perspective admin can edit show and delete any users create show edit and delete any companies but it cannon create new user. besides when i click the link of house the page jump out which means that there is no way that i can see any houses listed. from reactor perspective reactor can sign up and log in. apart from these there is no other function that realized in the system. a reactor cannon switch his her role or edit his her profile cannon list houses choose company she he belongs to and reply any inquiries from hunters. from the perspective of hunter authors just realized the function of sign and sign in. besides those it does have any other functions that the system is supposed to have. besides there are some problems in log in part. when i log out as admin and log in as reactor or hunter i can still access
0,problem in admin layout no option for updating profile for reactor reactor cannon create new company. reactor cannon view potential buyers of his company. reactor cannon view inquiries for house. reactor cannon submit replies for inquiries. reactor cannon sign out. hunter cannon edit his profile. hunter cannon view real estate company information. hunter cannon add house in his interested list. hunter cannon sign out. admin cannon view inquiries.
0,reactor has to choose company while signing up. reactor can not create company. admin has to create the company for reactor reactor cannon create house. after clicking on the create house button some exception is thrown in the console. reactor can not list house. layout is not working. since the house can not be listed and there are no houses in the system other can not be tested. the basic are not working.
0,some edge cases are working.
1, unable to test the edge cases as the many are not working as stated above. the layout functionality does not work. user is enabled to login as an admin and reactor at the same time but cannon log out. the validation have still not been implemented in the application for example entities can be created without adding any details in the field. please find the real estate company creation screen as below real estate company was successfully created. real estate company was successfully created. name webster address size founded revenue synopsis
0,admin can delete real estate company. clicking destroy takes it back to the show page. so could test the first use case. reactor is unable to create new houses and admin does have the option to create houses. so could test the second use case. can see inquiries and potential buyers. show page running into errors. due to the combination of these issues could test any of these edge cases.
0,poor validation checks
0,unable to list houses in the application. since the basic are not working the edge cases could not be tested.
0,the team has written multiple test cases for the controllers of all the entities however has not written any for the models.
0,no test cases for models. controllers are partially tested.
1,code quality was not upto the mark. firstly there were separate table for and which caused lot of redundancy inside the application as well as for the user using the product. secondly the lack of proper documentation made it very difficult to traverse through the code.
0,the code follows all design style guidelines for ruby. good job. all methods are well designed and serve only one function. naming and structure is uniform across the project.
0,the users controller has lot of nested if block in the method and method
0,in general the code seemed to look fine. there were some really long methods like in the users controller class so i docked star. there was separate method for adding to interest list.
0,the code is clean and readable and has been properly 
0,the code is clean and easy to understand. code principles are followed didn find any major code duplication issues.
1,yes the code was extremely clean and readable. the naming represented the task such as remove from interest list show potential buyers etc of the method and no extra load was carried by that method except for the action assigned to the method. no methods were longer than necessary and no unnecessary nesting was present. though not major suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as my interest list and houses posted by me for method naming. also as methods are referred to as actions naming should reflect an action so add show in front of naming such as houses posted by company
0,yes code is clean and easy to read. has followed coding standards there are separate functional calls for each task.
1,the commits were not regular. the development cycle seems to be rushed one since the commits are too concentrated near the deadline and too sparse in between them.
0,the team committed changes fairly frequently. there are no commits for the first phase of the project. however the project saw regular contributions after that during the round. overall good job. could be more proactive during the first phase.
0,they only had commits which i think is little low considering there were two phases of submission. in my first phase my team had at least commits.
0,for the most part it looks like this group only committed changes in round two. i know there was roughly one commit when i reviewed the first time and the remainder of the changes were between oct.
0,yes they did keep pushing updates after round.
0,yes the commit count has almost doubled from round to round.
0,yes the team had multiple changes committed through oct th through oct in round
0,the team has committed regularly.
1,the system does not portray good database design. first of all there are two separate tables for enquiries and reply to enquiries which is highly not normalised. also the fact that there are separate tables for the three types of users is also very in efficient and non scalable. it does make an attempt to map the various relationships but it seems it is not properly tested and is prone to many bugs.
0,the relationship reactor has many houses is not represented. however all other edge cases are covered. the db is well designed with clear relationships and field names. this team is pro.
0,it looks like all the needed relationships were present in the schema.
0,cardinal relationships have been defined in appropriate models
0, and n relationships are all properly defined
1,the team has partially handled the relationships. has many they have aptly provided all the has many relationships such as has many houses relator a house hunter has many interest and inquiry etc. one more relation should have been relator has many houses under him. most of these relations are bi directional associations so there should ideally have been belongs to relation. such as if company has many then relator belongs company is an association. no such relations are found in code. also as the reactor can only be linked to one company at time this calls for has one relation.
1,db design does have key reference and or many relationships in active records are missing but the same is implemented via code logic.
0,there are lot of missing. like ability to add photos for the house being one of them. for the which are present there are quite few bugs. for example signing in again after signing up reactor being able to delete any houses whether or not listed by him etc. there are few added after the first round but the implementation is not upto the mark.
0,all basic work as expected. you could have gone for the extra credit functionality such as the login or the email part. the email part was pretty easy. you ve still done great job with the overall design. the best i ve seen thus far.
0,admin can create houses which then means can add to interest list or make inquiries reactor can view list of potential buyers for house hunter does everything it needs to do
0,authors delivered nearly all the functionality i could think to test. it was little weird being referred to totally different page to have to unload images to houses but not enough to deduct points.
0,after logging in as reactor or house hunter if we press the button create house or an inquiry and before creating if we press back button the user is taken to home page where he has to log in again.
0, of the are covered. issues. a reactor could edit the information of houses that were not part of his her company. option to sign as both reactor and hunter at the same time is missing. role switching feature is missing if user has both hunter and reactor roles. feature to delete the unloaded image for house is missing. there was no option to view the replies sent to hunters queries.
1,all basic functionality outlined by the test suite is working as expected with few corner case bugs. the filter functionality should have been more flexible to filter for range of price and sq ft rather than try to match exact numbers provided which is not user friendly. also the reactor sign should allow reactor to choose company from list available which is more user friendly
0,yes major changes and feature implementations are there after st round. all basic are working properly.
0, admin can delete real estate companies with attached to it reactor is being able to delete any house admin can delete house hunter with several enquires.
0,all test cases are covered. the does cover how edge cases are covered but that not an issue.
0,if real estate company is deleted has houses and reactor then the house and inquiries are deleted too. when you change your company as reactor then you can edit houses listed from another company but it still shows up. the inquiries are deleted if the respective hunter is deleted
0,when i delete real estate company all the in that company get deleted too. can still edit houses they made for one company after they switch companies.
0,deletes. nope. deletes. no edge cases mentioned
0,when the company of reactor was changed reactor details got updated with this new company details. but he could still edit update the houses that he she had listed for the prey company. they could send replies to inquiries also. a reactor could edit the details of all the houses. what will happen if the admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries. cascade delete in working. other major edge cases are also working.
0, when the admin deletes real estate company all the associated with them are deleted along with all the houses posted by those . currently the reactor is able to edit delete houses of other companies which is the fault in the behavior and the team needs to correct this to test this edge case. if admin deletes house hunter all their queries are automatically they are deleted from potential buyers list. if relator replies to the query the house hunter is unable to see them in the system. ii validation on phone numbers should be enforced. iii session handling could be improved few left over data are present on screen after logging out and using direct links to access page. such as hunter query after logging out. no documentation on regarding edge cases.
0,ifadmin deletes company which has and houses the reactor associated with it get deleted. reactor can change her company and she can delete the ad posts previously posted by can delete the house hunter who has several queries and inquiries get deleted automatically.
0,except the login controller none of the models controller seems to be well are no test cases written for any of the controllers or in general any component of the application.
0,testing has not been done. models and controllers are well designed hence the points. you could have used basic spec tests to validate the flow of control.
0,i looked through all the files in the test folder and don see any tests filled in. they seem to only be the pre filled skeleton.
0,the controller and model tests were not updated.
0,only test skeleton present no actual tests implemented.
0,testing is not covered.
0,i don see test available for controller or model in the code and as its not documented whether different type of test implementation is available i am marking this unavailable.
0,could see default 
0,the code is well written following the right for coding practices
0,follows good coding practice at most places.
0,code is written in an efficient clean and readable manner. all the functions are lucid and defined properly in blocks. a proper use of names for controllers migrations and views can be seen.
0,yes the coding style was good
1,ruby guidelines are followed to good extent. clean and legible code. a few things can be written in more ruby like manner like the index method of house controller. e.g. min price something if.. would be better and more concise alternative. models can have more validations. other than that code is well written.
0,the have been done regularly throughout the development period even during the round.
0,code has been submitted frequently.
0,commit were done at timely manner
0,a lot of commits were done in phase. a total of commits were performed which is quite impressive. it shows that the team was working in timely manner so well done there. however i deducted star as i could see commits done after the deadline on oct.
0,the and n relationships are properly handled.
0,handles most of the relationships properly.
0,all the relationships are correct. also the houses table shows the time at which the house was created which is impressive. additionally the real estate company also shows the number of for each company good work on that.
0,yes even constraints were defined well
0,relationships are implemented correctly.
0,there were issues with the admin in the first round. they have been fixed.
0, admin cannon reply to inquiries posted by the users. if he can i am not able to find that option from the dashboard. admin cannon delete the real estate companies in some random cases. works in some. i could not find the option to switch between hunter and reactor roles. search is case sensitive
0, all the major work and most of them work. however there are couple of bugs that could be solved after submitting inquiry and clicking back the user is redirected to the page where all the messages in the database are shown the reactor is not able to view the potential buyers for any house the look and all the major are running smoothly. great work on that.
0,most issues were fixed
0,admin can not delete or edit companies the search functionality for houses is not working filter by min price admin can add house to only one company. admin can not view list of users admin can not delete inquiries from the system. reactor can not view inquiries sent to houses in the company not posted by him
0,the quality of the code is reasonably good. would it be possible for the team to avoid using the little interpretable ruby they use in the files and instead use the controllers and its helpers for writing all logic.
0,while trying to delete real estate company with existing the system is failing.
0,handles most of the edge cases properly. there are some bugs related to messages as could not test it properly. in some cases deleting user or company fails.
1,overall the code is written in an extremely clean and readable way. having said that i would like to propose one suggestion which may help in future. there instances where code has been added in the index function of controllers namely houses controller list of pot buyers controller after the if else condition if search exists or not the main search logic in houses controller could be added to new function by passing the search to that function. similarly in list of pot buyers controller the sql queries should be put in other functions say def generate list of potential buyers
0,i think the code is well written. the function calls are very well done. it is neat and easily readable. also there is no bad naming the project. code very well follows the dry approach.
1,unfortunately all the edge cases in the given question are failing the system encounters an error while deleting real estate company after changing the real estate company the reactor can still delete the house that he had created with previous company even after deleting the user from the dashboard the queries submitted by the users are not deleted there was no potential buyers list available for viewing even after adding houses to the interest list myself these cases could be seen upon and improved
0,the code is clean and easily understood. a separate controller for adding the buyers to the potential buyer list is created. overall the structure and naming of controllers and migration file is clear and the respective can be identified based on the names. the team has done good work on that
0,the code itself is fairly clean and readable. the class is poorly named and i not sure you need separate class for it.
0,function calls are added. code is formatted and neat. naming conventions are followed.
0,the also got deleted its company house cannon be removed inquires will not get deleted with the removed house hunter
0,several linear commits visible on the git. most of the work done in round is fixes and additional on top of the base that was finished before round.
0,the team promptly handled the task by working on it regularly and committing changes frequently.
0,i was unable to judge if this works there was no way for me to determine that. the admin can not delete companies can not view edit or delete or also users cannon delete themselves. further the third party admin gem or module used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either it gives an error on hero thus i was unable to determine if the edge cases work. also does not specify anything.
0,by looking at their page i could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round as well.
0,most the things are done in phase only. but few things are missing. house hunter can edit delete his inquiry. no page for house hunter to see what all he has marked as interested. not able to figure out as house hunter if have marked house interested or not. reactor not. able to reply to inquiry its throwing error.
0,the team submitted the changes at equal intervals of time and the last commit was performed day prior to the deadline which is commendable.
0,this team continued to commit throughout the project.
0,team has been consistent in pushing code changes
0,the test for real estate companies controller and real estate company model are present.
0,they have tested real estate company controller and model.
0,yes there are commits. well done.
0,yes they have implemented unit tests as well as functional tests.
1,it seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource user that is already indexed on some other resource user. the solution to that issue would be adding destroy dependency in model files for example for house hunters has many inquiries dependent destroy
0, the team has done an impressive job in handling the tests for messages and real estate companies.
0,houses up after deleting company. when reactor switches companies their old listed house still shows up and is editable. no potential buyer list
0,yes can see variety of edge cases being tested
1,tests have been implemented for model and controller. however i believe that they are not exhaustive. only one test case which will succeed has been implemented. you should try to implement more test cases like what happens when one of the things which is mandatory is absent. further i am afraid that the tests are not testing the correct thing. for eg should create real estate company tests assert redirected to real estate companies r.id while it should be testing if the company can be saved.
1,user role once user is created and goes to edit their profile if they check both roles there is no way for that user to get any role back. their should be check in the user table that both roles cannon be blank. also unfortunately there is no mention of how the system handles edge cases in the file
0, if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses it would not delete the record because dependent reactor exists. the reactor can change his real estate company and he won be prohibited from removing houses. if admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers list.
0,if company is deleted the reactor and houses does get deleted. and if house gets deleted the inquires are not getting deleted.
0,unfortunately most of the edge cases fail. the houses of the are listed even after deleting the real estate company. also the list display the associated with the deleted real estate company. the reactor is able to access the houses owned by old real estate companies after changing their own real estate company after deleting user the inquiries continue to be listed
0,this system is not properly linked together. real estate companies are not required to list houses can see and respond to all inquiries from everyone creation of inquiries is not linked to specific house.
0,one thing is that once the company that reactor belongs to was destroyed he or she can also list houses and that should be reconsidered.
0,the code looks comprehensive to good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. adding the remove from wish list feature is plus point. the naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. no problem with respect to the coding clarity.
0,the quality of the code is impeccable. use of helper files and establishing specific user through def current user function in the application helper allowed the team to use common user parameter throughout the application development and reduced the amount of effort that would have been needed other wise.
0, code is very much readable. there are proper comments before the functions.
0,the code is well written. it is neat and easily readable. the function calls are very well done. also there is no bad naming the project. code very well follows the dry approach.
1,confusing method naming eg can create can edit can destroy etc all should return true false but requests as well which should be done in the parent method which calls them
0,code quality seems to be very good. documentation along with instructions are present.
0,mapping has been properly implemented.
0,the database design is close to perfect. the destroy and delete dependencies have also been well managed to allow deletion in cases where house hunter gets deleted and all its inquiries are deleted automatically.
0, yes the system does handle the relationships and the mappings are clearly defined.
0,i think the system handles the to and to relationships well. the relationships are clearly defined with no problems.
0,this system handle the to and to relationships
0,the code on has to relationship between real estate company and reactor it also facilitates to create real estate companies of their own. my doubt is whether the reactor can view update and delete the real estate company created by him because i could not find such functionality implemented in the application as well as the code.
1,kind off. i felt that admin should have been able to delete the company irrespective of the belonging to the company. i felt that that scenario should have been handled in one of the following ways. reactor associated to the company should be deleted obviously not preferable. reactor continues to exist but without the company and thereby no houses or inquiries assigned to him.
0,the above case is covered.
0,the controller has been very well tested by the team.
0, the test cases are running fine. clear steps for the same are given in the 
0,excellent use of spec
0,yes the team has tested thoroughly at least one model and one controller.
0,no test cases have been written
0,there seems to be no testing done.
0,there any commit after the first submission.
0,there are several linear commits to show progression of all the that were added to the project from the beginning. the team had more or less finished their work before round and fixed few bugs that were not easily discernible in round.
0, there are commits i can see with clear commit messages.
0,by looking at their page i could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round as wealth
0, commits by one whereas by the other two i was expecting an even number of commits
0,the team has done good job in submitting changes throughout the project. the team has not committed changes in round.
0,very good by entire team. project was handled well and not messy.
1,same issues as of first review. cannon delete company. reason cited is dependent reactor exist. i suggest that when company is removed reactor should have company too. because reactor can exist without company in his profile too. admin cannon edit his her details
0,the system has no perceivable issues.
0, are working fine. they are well documented in separate pdf file as well. even the read me contains clear instructions for setup.
0,i could not find the filters tab in the show houses section for the house hunter. rest everything looks great.
0,most of the are working correctly. one necessary feature that is not working as expected is inquiries. there are broken links when admin reactor tries to view inquiries.
0,almost every feature is working as it supposed to.
0,app as whole works very well. the look and feel of it is also very good. contributes to very good overall user experience.
1,cannon delete company. reason cited is dependent reactor exist. reactor is able to delete houses that he created when he was in company a after changing to company b. when hunter is deleted by admin and inquiries are checked the page does show up. deployment error edge cases company cannon be created without filling all details. this is implemented. session control when user signs out from page and then goes back the profile page should not be shown as he is signed out. this should be considered.
0,the system was able to pass all listed test cases. all the views have been perfectly setup as well and have disabled buttons where needed.
0, there are enough edge cases tested and well documented in the attached pdf file. could also view the some points to be taken care that are documented in specific cases.
0,the only thing i had trouble with was changing from house hunter to reactor and back. it possible i just missed the option. in my opinion that is rather insignificant omission.
0, if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses it would not delete the record because dependent reactor exists. the reactor can change his real estate company and he won be prohibited from removing houses. if admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers list.
0,when admin tries to delete real estate company that has and house hunters in it there is an error that says cannon delete record because of dependent . since real estate company is foreign key in the reactor table the system does not allow the deletion of real estate companies that have under it. when reactor changes his real estate company the houses that are listed by him are unaffected. the system also allows the reactor to delete houses listed in the previous company. i was unable to view inquiries after logging in as admin hence i am not able to inspect the condition of submitted inquiries after the hunter who created the inquiries has been deleted.
0,test case could have been handled better.
0,code written well with all dry principles. methods are simple and clean. every method contains functions specific methods are simple and clean. every method contains functions specific 
0,code is clear and concise with explanatory commits
0,looks decent.
0,the code in this project generally appears to be readable. home controller should probably have different name just because controllers are generally supposed to be plural but there is only one home in their webster their house search controller appears to be in the model section of the project though.
1,it would be more modular if house hunters and admin were different table. since they are clubbed under users table there are many checks performed in most of the views. cannon identify user names company names as ids are displayed. it would be helpful if this can be modified.
0,coding standards are followed properly
0,yes. the team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. the team even kept pushing commits during round. though it seems like only of the team members did the majority of work.
0,yes they did commit changes in round. but it seems only one person has contributed in group of
0,this team continued pushing changes throughout the project.
0,the team kept on committing on the regular bases but needed team collaboration. mostly commits are from one person.
0,the file is completed and explicit so great.
0,foreign key integration is been done in db but as there are no separate active records for user types hunter reactor admin hence the many relations are absent.
0,the mappings are present and clearly defined
0,inquiry does seem to belong to house and there is no table for potential buyer
0,the relationships appear to be documented correctly here.
0,some of the missing relationships i identified. company has many houses. house has many inquiries. reactor has one company
0,active record relationships are missing. all the relations are implemented through code logic.
0,could not add company as reactor also could not attach and display picture when listing house. when signing up as house hunter was asked to select real estate company. the house interest interest list feature has not been implemented. also the inquiry is not associated with listed house. cannon delete real estate companies.
0,the are working fine. the input fields in the forms have good explanations for some specific cases.
0,no way for house hunter to to interested in house. a user not able to have multiple roles
0,potential buyers section is missing
0,yes it works perfectly fine
0,this system does not seem to work correctly. when i log in as reactor and go to view companies i get something went wrong error from hero telling me to check the logs. validation in adding houses also does seem to work correctly.
0,most of the seem to work fine. below are some of them which break or are to view current user company breaks and there is nothing to show. there is no option to change user company. there is no interest list for house hunter. there is no potential buyer list for listing.
0,basic are working fine.
0,could not test most of the edge cases as have not been implemented.
0,many of the edge cases are covered. one issue i found is that the back buttons for admin in the edit admin page and real estate companies page moves in loop.
0,deleting company does delete does his her inquiries.
0,validations are properly provided to handle edge cases
0,a reactor changing real estate company makes them unable to edit houses they ve listed with the previous company.
0,this test fails as corresponding houses and are not deleted. the reactor current company is not visible feature break thus it fails. this test case fails as inquiry of the user is not deleted.
0,if the admin deletes reactor company accounts house ads posted by them still shows. if reactor changes his company then he can no delete the ad post posted by him previously. if an admin deletes house hunters inquiries remain saved.
1,if the company that reactor belongs to is deleted his or her company will be the admin company which i think may nit be the best choice. the company can be empty and in that case the reactor should nit be able to list house. the inquiry should be able to show the hunter name not the code string.
0,test cases for the user have not been implemented.
0,there could be more test cases included and did not find enough information on test cases in the read me.
0,tested but not thoroughly.
0,houses and inquiries controller seem to be thoroughly tested as do house inquiry search and user models.
0,apart from the ones that are generated during scaffold there are no new test cases added to test the application.
0,not mentioned in file and couldnt find any in code.
0,missing many for reactor and house hunter such as login.
0,the admin account is created in the user model instead of the database seeds file. other than that the project looks pretty good code wise.
1,code looks okay but i found few features missing. as far as code is concerned found admin details hard coded in the code this is wrong way to do. could have used tables for better alignment
0,the code is very modular and clean. there is no bad naming in the project naming conventions are followed. all the methods are concise. there are not many nested blocks and the code is clear and easy to understand. however the functionality of creating house is written under inquiry which makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the flow of the webster
0,code is compliant to rails coding style
0,i afraid the code is not well organized because the functions are not working properly.
0,nearly all commits occurred during round.
0,yes they did.
0,it seems like almost all changes were made on one day for part of the project.
0,found commits only near the deadlines.
0,the team has committed changes after round one. however there are less number of commits and are not spread throughout the life of the project. a single commit is used for various which makes it difficult to understand the exact functionality changes. the commit messages are not appropriate which makes it harder to find out what the fix is about. there are commits even after the round deadline.
0,none of the models specify any belongs to or has many relationship and no migrate nor schema stores an official reference to be used.
0,the inquiries are linked to house hunters.
0,no idea if it works as there was no admin login or create company functionality.
0,none of the relationships are handled with the built in has one has many or belongs to functionality except the user model which randomly belongs to 
0,relationships are missing for eg relation between inquiry and sender receiver missing.
0,there is relationship established between users and the company. however relationship between house and reactor or company has not been established. this has negative impacts on the functionality. there is no relationship between an inquiry and house hunter or reactor which has impacts on the functionality. for example if certain house hunter is deleted from the data base the inquiry associated with the house hunter will not be destroyed.
0,the relationships between inquiries and house house and company potential users and house are absent.
0,houses cannon be created.
0,the view inquiries link takes you to the wrong page. users can view nor edit their profile. there in as far as i can tell any way to post house as reactor
0,can switch between house hunter and user. anyone can create house. viewing inquiries directs to creating house. admin not configured that i can tell. creating changing real estate companies in implemented.
0, preferred contact does have call as one of the options. as house hunter i am unable to view and edit my profile. as reactor i am unable to view and edit my profile. wrong error message while creating house oops could create account. please make sure you are using valid email and password and try again. while creating house the reactor is needed to list the potential buyers which is wrong analysis. as house hunter shows interest in the house this information will be populated. as house hunter i am unable to create company. as reactor i am unable to view or edit company as house hunter i am unable to create an inquiry as an admin i am unable to edit and delete users as an admin i am unable to edit houses interests and inquiry features are not yet implemented.
0,basic missing
0,view inquiries links to the page and when you are creating any type of object there seems to be no validation and you are required to manually input things like id. it seems like inquiries don exist in the system and when you create house it done through the inquiry page.
0,no lot of specified features still missing
0,the login and sign up page work as expected. but the following have changes to be implemented the view is poorly developed. admin login credentials are not mentioned so could not test the admin functionality. validation for phone number and email id has not been done. the system accepts number which has less than digits and an invalid email id. creation of new house is inside inquiries tab under page which is misleading. not able to associate reactor with company hence not able to validate the update and delete functionality of company from inside the page. not able to switch between reactor and house hunter if an user is both. delete and update have not been implemented. inquiry creation from house hunter page is not implemented.
0,many don work as mentioned in the requirement. does provide enough description on how to finish the tasks.
0,it seems not working properly. when logged in as reactor click on the view inquiry will jump to the house page.
0,there no way to actually test this but from the code i don believe that any of the edge cases would do anything.
0, admin not implemented real estate company functionality missing. admin not implemented the was updated to reflect the state of the application. as best i can tell the app does handle any known edge case.
0,the edge cases have not been handled as these edge cases depend on one or more basic that have not yet been implemented.
0,no idea.
0,the edge cases are testable because of the incompleteness of the project
0,admin details in missing no way to create real estate company when admin tries creating new user sign button shows it should not be in user lists can see multiple admin accounts with same user name email
0,there is no admin credentials provided so could not test the edge cases which involves admin. could not establish relationship between reactor and company. there is no delete and update functionality provided so could not validate the edge cases related to them.
0,no controller nor model is tested.
0,it hard to tell but there does seem to be an attempt at test even though some functionality is still missing.
0,no testing done.
0,no models or controllers are tested
0,no automated tests for model and controller missing
0,the team has to tested any model or controller.
0,test for model are missing. basic test cases for controllers are present but the testing is not through.
0,the code is clean and readable.
0,code looks quite readable
0,looks alright.
0,the code generally is simple and understandable. blocks are simple but maybe its because few features are missing.
0, no validations implemented on the model attributes. the models do not have associations implemented.
0,the code is clean and well written. the controllers and models are named accurately and each filename describes the desired functionality. good work on that.
1,code looks good. the first cut for good too. i still do not see code for models in model files if an additional gem has been used it would be good to mention that in 
0,no mapping table present anywhere. no belongs to has many relationship present in the models
0,could not really find the required relationship mapping.
0,no for e.g house should belong to real estate company but its not handled in house
0,the system properly handles the relationships where real estate company can have multiple also it supports reactor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list.
1,i am unable to find many relationships in the model though functionality seems to be in place either additional gems have been used or code has been pushed in schema which is wrong.
0, admin cannon create new house it redirect to error page. cannon reply to inquiries.
1,the system performs all the desired a to the idea for the auto filled inquiries. i really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry. some parts need improvement. for ex the link new houses in the house list redirect to the users edit link. its minor issue which could be looked upon. the layout of the homage for house hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other. also the houses list shows edit destroy options for the entire house list that a bug which needs fixing.
0,yes st cut did not have hero link this time apart from additional code link is present and may of non functional flows seems to be in place
0,the code is clean and readable. it is and follows ruby standard namingg conventions. in most of the code each method handles one task. the interest list code was seen in houses. namin seems to be done appropriately. none
0,all code written is clearly in separate and well defined methods. although the program still misses out on comments but you can still find out what particular part does as the methods have been named appropriately.
0,in general the code of this system is in clean and readable and written in the mac way. but there are some problems in the code. for example in the reactor controller there is no method to handle the join action when reactor wants to join in new company. and reactor can not receive inquires from hunter. besides in the models folder i seems redundant to me role users and users roles making reader easily confused.
0,different methods for different functionality. no long methods. overall good job by the team on the structure of the project.
0,the code is clearly written and easy to understand. the are separated and well defined.
0,commits are exactly spread evenly across the entire duration of the project. but they have made changes in round. there have been significant improvements in the functionality and overall code in the project from my previous review.
0,with commits te team has continuously pushed changes to git to keep the version control in tact.
0,the team has been constantly submitting changes to the repository with each team member having considerable commits which says the work was divided equally among team members.
0,yes i think the whole team has been participated in this project and kept on submitting changes throughout the project and they still keep on submitting changes in round even though the deadline for round has passed. their last record of commitment is on oct.
0,good job on the comments and description of the git commit. it makes the job of the product owner lead software to review your code.
0,the commits were fairly frequent even in round.
0,most of the relationships have been implemented. i could log in to the admin
0,the project mentions the belongs to and has many parts of the problem specification in the right ruby files so they are handled correctly
0,yes authors have done great job in this part and they handle the to and to relationships properly.
0,good job on the db design. mappings between model are good.
0,relationships are properly defined and mapping is correct.
0,basic seem to be working now. i could see that there have been many been added in round which were present in round. though certain are still not present. eg. reactor joining real estate company.
0,unable to view newly created house.
1,the system has all the required functionality. however it would also be useful if the file explained where some of the features are incorporated. for instance the submit inquiry field is located on the show page for the houses. this is not immediately intuitive. it could help if that is mentioned in the 
0,no not really. first of all i still cannon login in as admin according to the account and password offered in file. so i cannon see what could happen when i log in as an admin. even though hunter can put an inquiry for house but the reactor are not able to reply it. however compared to the commitment in round they have made lot of improvements but the admin part is still falling.
0,admin login is failing with the credentials provided in the file. not able to test any functionality of admin. clicking on show button for the house results in error page when i have logged in as reactor deleting my own account results in error.
0,app crashes when i try to create app crashes when i try to create house etc app crashes when i try to add multiple into company
0,cannon sign in as reactor after signing in as you can view list.
0,the basic work nicely. creating houses sign and house search inquiry and reply etc work correctly. all the validations are present. however few are not working. a house without photo can not be seen error in showing the house. houses information index is shown incorrectly forgot to add table headings. potential buyer functionality not implemented correctly can not see any details just show edit delete options. admin can not delete companies houses or if they are referenced elsewhere see next answer below for details. reactor cannon reply to inquiry and cannon destroy his house. admin can not see inquiries even when some are there.
0,i was able to log in from the admin role to test. when i tested the reactor was able to join real estate company. could login from admin account.
0,unable to switch real estate companies leads to an error page.
0,the feature to add company to reactor does not work correctly in the application. the app crashes when he chooses the company. the team could try to fix this issue and correspondingly handle the edge cases.
1,the admin account can be deleted by the admin. this should not happen. the admin account should be indestructible.
0,first of all i cannon login as an admin so i cannon validate most of edge cases. but through the way they handle the relationships between models. i think some of the edge cases may not happen after fixing the problem.
0,application errors out in edge cases. deleting house shows error. user deletion throws an error.
0,app crashes if i test any of these mentioned cases
1,admin cannon delete real estate companies users or houses. i found that admin can delete these if they are not related to anything else i.e. if there is house which is not present in interest list has no inquiries than it can be deleted. ditto others. i suspect that the error is thrown as the entry is being referenced in some other table as foreign key. this would imply that edge cases have not been implemented or are for some reason not working on hero
0,yes i could not create another account with the same email. validations seem to be done on user level while creating account signing in etc
0,most models seem to be tested with few errors in some places.
1,the team has implemented test for the user model and controller. however it would make for better design if they used the spec framework to do the test. more comprehensive test cases could be tested such as if the passwords of the user don match.
0,yes they did put effort on test part. they have done good job in testing model users.
0,some test cases are written but not complete for one model and controller.
0,only basic test cases have been given for any cont
0,i could not find any file in which tests have been implemented and neither is the file mentioned in 
0,code in the files are auto generated. every function is implemented in clean and readable manner and performs only one task. code on whole follows ruby on rails practices.
0,code is clean and readable. yes. no. no file is well written and descriptive.
1,the code quality is fairly standard the code practices dry principles fairly well. i would suggest creating new controllers for managing house hunters and from admin profile since on creating new reactor house hunter the admin logs out and this seems like stop gap fix.
0,some files like comment don suggest what they are used for
0,the code contains comments which makes it little hard to read than that the organisational way methods are handled good
0,the code on is clean and readable. the controller actions are specific and do only the tasks that are required. the naming convention used is also intuitive. the interest list functionality has not been implemented.
0,the code is quite clearly written with all the good coding practices being followed.
0,yes team kept on submitting their changes throughout the project. only file was updated in round.
0,the commits are many and have been done in round as well. the commits were evenly spaced through the development cycle.
0,although there are too many commits the team does seem to have been updating their git in continuous manner.
0,all commits on same day before submission
0,a total of comments and recently updated also.
0,can see the commits in single shot on few particular days. yes the team has committed changes in round
0,the team has committed changes in round.
0, commits overall with about commits for round.
0,yes to and to relationships are handled correctly. tables are mapped correctly.
0,most of the mappings are done correctly.
1,the relationships have been set up properly in the model files as well as the schema. however destroy dependency in the model file would be great addition has many enquiries dependent destroy
1,the dependencies are not handled properly. it errors out when we try to delete parent record like company or house. use of dependent destroy and proper mentioning on belongs to and has many relationship in all models should solve this issue
0,the code on shows the to relationship between real estate company and reactor the reactor is also able to create real estate companies of his own.
0,yes the mapping is done quite well.
0,admin login fails and other users successful. all works.
0,some of the are not fully implemented. admin login functionality is failing. the credentials given in the file are probably wrong. houses listed by are not being displayed in the index page. the edit delete houses by reactor is not functional are unable to view inquiries and submit replies house hunters are unable to create interest lists and hence both interest list and potential buyers functionality is missing from the application.
0,the system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas. not able to sign in as admin with account. how to add inquiries or to an interest list.
0,sign functionality was not working. i could not log in from the admin role and house hunter role provided. after logging in from reactor account the link to inquiries failed was broken.
1,the type of user in the view user panel through admin login is unavailable would it be possible for the team to have two separate views controllers and crud functions on and hunters.
0,unable to delete users from admin why can the admin edit password of the users.
0,there are still session variables and route names being displayed on some of the screens which were suggested to be removed. the functionality is quite good considering there was no implementation during first review. potential buyers functionality is not implemented. enquiry functionality does work. it throws application error check logs error when clicked. possibly deployment issue. when new house is created it is not displayed in the listings immediately. admin login does work. it may be possible that someone might have edited admin login during review or else please paste the latest login details in 
0,clicking on list of inquiries broke the application.
1,deletion fails in most cases as dependent records don get deleted. model changes to add and delete these dependencies will resolve the issue.
0,after creating the user from the admin why i am logged into the created user. also where can the user update the company info
0,as of now i not able to sign in as admin with account i can comment om test cases.
0,could not login from the admin credentials provided. reactor cannon change the real estate company. he she is able to update the real estate company information which in my opinion is the function of the admin. could not login from the admin credentials provided. reactor can list house without giving details of
1,the admin is unable to destroy real estate company due to the above mentioned dependency bug on the model files. since all users are listed in common view without information about who is reactor and who is house hunter the admin would be unable to specifically test removing type of user unless he she creates one themselves. on changing real estate company through update for reactor the real estate company change was reflected else where has been implemented well. the reactor is also unable to see the inquires or reply to them.
0,edge cases are handled good and the is effective enough to understand the entire code flow.
0,could not log in as admin. rest worked as expected.
0,unable to login as admin. hence i was not able to test the scenario when real estate company is deleted by the admin. the list listing link shows only the pre existing houses by default. even after applying the appropriate search filters the newly created houses are not being displayed. hence i was unable to test scenario of change of real estate company. since the admin login is not working the test on inquiries could not be performed.
0,no tests are added for any model or controller
0,no specific testing apart from scaffold generated tests seems to have been implemented by the team.
0,only default tests are present
0, file seems to be missing
0,the team has not tested model. the code in has the default controller tests. the team has not used the spec gem to perform model controller tests.
0,could not find model or controller testing.
0,only one person has committed throughout the project which looks strange to me. however there have been regular commits by the person.
0,yes code is clean and readable. there are no issues with code quality or naming and methods are mostly short and performs only one task.
0, yes. code is well structured overall. interests and potential buyers functionality are separated from house hunter model view. proper naming conventions are followed
0, no issue found. classes looks very clean and nicely naming.
1,sessions create method has large code blocks for the three role types. it would have been better to create separate methods for each type
0, no validations have been implemented in any models. dependent constraints or foreign keys are not checked for destroy action
0,the quality of the code was efficient. it allowed to use the system in an understandable manner. it followed approach for clean coding using ruby and rails.
0,the code is clean and easy to read.
0,yes team kept on submitting their changes throughout the project and no commits are made in round.
0,they made commits but some commits combined lot of features together at once
1,all commits were on just days before and on the day of submission. it will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.
0, commits during the last week
0,yes the commit increased from to.
0,the team worked on lot of things from the first stage. this includes testing for admin and reactor allowing admin user to view and destroy the accounts of reactor and house hunter.
0, commit the last one was on oct.
0,code quality is impressive. every action has different function call. the methods are well defined to understand to purpose it serves.
0,the code quality is generally good. there are several places with large blocks of commented out code that should be removed. functions are small however and models are used properly where they should be.
0,there are lines that were tested but commented out which makes it little tough to read. other than that the flow of the code methodologies are good.
0,the code is clean. naming conventions are followed.
0,have followed good ruby coding practices with meaningful variable names. single responsibility paradigm is well portrayed.
0,the code is clean and solid. easy to read.
0,commits in the repo are consistent. commits show some changes were made to improve the 
0,this team pushed code in few very burst times but they did push commits after the initial review.
0,the team has committed the code continuously. yes the team had made commits in round also.
0,they have consistently checked in code during the project duration even in phase.
0,the last commit is in.
0,yes code handles the mapping as mentioned in the given example
0,yes the db design looks to have the proper relationships.
0,there are plenty of relations mentioned in the model files. for the mentioned case as well.
0,there is search which seems very vague and unused. it has an extensive search logic. it should be method in the house file instead of separate file of its own.
0,unable to view an enquiry for house.
0,the reactor cannon delete the company he she created. also if the house hunter shows interest for one house the interest and inquiry by the potential house hunter is submitted for all the house present. admin cannon create house and assign it to company. admin cannon delete company.
0,it does seem this team tried to address my earlier feedback but i still experienced several problems. i found the following issues i was unable to login as an admin. navigation in this app was difficult. there were not very intuitive links. there were too many clicks to add remove interest. the inquiries listing gave me an error. this app did not keep track of my session very well. the search houses only had one filter
1, if house hunter is interested in house there should be only one entry specifying this interest in the database. in this app the same house hunter can show multiple interests on the same house. this results to duplicates in db and must be handled. after creating an inquiry clicking on the back link on the page should re direct to houses or which ever page was visited before creating an inquiry. this is not happening. founded year field of the company table takes any numeric value founded the house hunter is able to create company which is not supposed to be an allowed operation. this happens when as house hunter i edit profile and choose to be reactor i get an option to create company but even without changing the role to reactor point holds good for built year field of house table view inquiries feature is not an error.
0,reactor is not able to reply. there is no text field for the reply. only subject and content is visible while editing and inquiry when logged in as reactor not able to delete user after logging in as admin. error page got displayed.
1,comments from round are taken care of. delete real estate company crashed. view inquiry lists inquiries from all houses including ones that are not under the same company. these should not be accessible to the reactor he should see only ones from houses in his company.
0,basic function still have some minor problem. like can view the potential buyers and when click view the inquiry the web page return an error.
0,unable to change company as reactor file in discussing any of the possible edge cases.
0,only admin is in the system rest all tables are empty. no dummy data is provided as of to test on multiple edge cases. there is no time to add on users companies houses inquiries to perform testing.
0,i can create company but i cannon join it as reactor if i already joined company without re the reactor on the edit profile page
0,edge cases are handled but agent described briefly on the 
0, admin trying to delete user that has an inquiry and interested in some house fails as expected but the failure is not graceful. admin can edit profile by making user neither reactor nor house hunter and delete that user that has inquiries and interests in on house. admin cannon destroy operation is throwing error but after updating company the company can be destroyed.
0,admin not able to delete houses or users or companies. unable to test few cases due to these issues. reactor not able to delete houses. error page is getting displayed.
0,edge cases not handled properly. company delete crashing until all and houses under it are deleted. house delete crashes until all inquiries on it are deleted.
0,enquiries haunt been tested.
0,tested for reactor account. the code handles the lifecycle of the user pretty well.
0,yes they tested the user controller and model
0,cant see spec folder.
0,test cases in user model present.
0,thorough testing has been done for user test and controllers.
0,they test different controllers and different models. vert convincing work.
1,code is written properly. simple and clean every function is simple and has distinguishing work. did not understand the need of creating mac for search photos separately. many could have been merged together and made defined solution. eg house search function could have been added in house mac
1,yes the changes were committed throughout but the commit messages could be bit more descriptive.
1,in general the code of this system is clean and readable but there are some problems in it. for example author didn handle the interest list properly. when reactor wants to see the potential buyers of house it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system. besides the reactor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company because the edit method in the controller is not realized. and in models some relationships should appear because one of the model is not created such as the model house hunters which has many queries but the model query is not created.
0,the code follows the general guidelines for quality and concept of clean coding. the models and controller were designed with general practice approach using ruby and rails coding methodologies.
0,functions are not named properly. example in photos controller.
0,code is clean and easy to understand. some unused empty function definitions are there in the files.
0,code looks neat and clean.
0,code is well written. all the conventions of the rails framework have been followed. the functions have been properly defined and does only what it is supposed to do.
0,the code was committed throughout the project and code was committed in the second round too.
0,yes. team is continuously pushing changed on the but not distributed equally among team mates. i could see commits till now.
0,this team is keep on submitting their changes throughout the project and not only one or two members of the team but all of them are playing role in this project. besides they did commit changes in round.
0,the team committed the changes in round but overall the commits were not consistent.
0,yes they committed lot of code after first review which can be due to the fact it was deployed by review. but overall the number of commits is higher than average believe
0,yes about commits.
0,the team improved upon certain aspects of their code. this included establishing the admin functions and actions as adding new companies and to view various participants involved.
1,relationships have not been properly defined in the models. for example in the company file the relationships have been commented out. also in the case of house model it had only been related to reactor and not to real estate company.
0,found that company has many users missing house has many inquiries and reply missing.
0,team has tried implementing relation between model but they does not seem to work well. deleting one branch of relation does not affect other branch though they are associated.
0,not really. first of all as i was mentioned above the relationship between house hunter and query didn handle properly. second reactor should belong to real estate company not has one and the real estate company should has many and the mapping of two models does not work. the company id of in list look like set of random number which has nothing to do with the table real estate company.
0,i think the system handles the to and to relationships well. the relationships are clearly defined with no problems.
0,seeing from the schema file the logic seems fine but unable to test it out.
0,there is only one relationship in the whole project. not good database design. plus destroying one entity won delete another as can see from the code. rest am not able to test as am not able to login other than admin. not able to register as well.
0,the code procedure and application justified the to and to relationships between the reactor and house hunter model as well as real estate company and reactor relationship mapped as to n.
0,no form validation in the create new company page. for example when founded field is given as text and updated it succeeds but the value is saved as. admin is unable to add new throws up an error. admin is unable to add new house hunters. throws up an error. not able to sign up as either reactor or house hunter. gives the something went wrong error. something is wrong with the deployment. please look into it.
1,search functionality for houses not found. asking for company id and reactor id which is difficult for the user to remember. a better would be to associate house based on company name or add the house to the company associated with the reactor admin not able to add admin not able add inquiries or reply to inquiries or add himself as potential buyer. unable to sign up as hunter or reactor only admin is able to create the users.
0, in the first release there was issue in user registration. the issue still persists. team has kept both reactor and house hunter registration on the same page that only allows house hunter to register. can not register new reactor using registration link. for simpler design team could have simply give links for types of user registration. team tried covering many as compared to last release and succeeded partially. team has provided admin credentials and admin are working fine.
0,they fix part of the problems showed in round. all kinds of user still cannon edit his own profile even though admin can perform crud of hunters and and the reactor can not replace and create new company. the hunter can not make inquires and reactor are not able to reply them. besides the search filter for the houses are not working. and when reactor views the house potential buyers he she will see all the hunters registered in the system.
0,i think the authors did good job in developing the system. the system is working as it is supposed to work.
0,i am unable to sign so could not login and check for but ui is improved lot and the confusing sign up page in round is fixed.
0,able to login with admin and use all but unable to sign for reactor or it shows the hero page we re sorry something went wrong
0,not able to login other than admin. not able to register myself. edit option is not working when admin is trying to edit. inquires respond to inquiry etc am not able to test as am not able to register myself. search not working on hero but they have mentioned its working in local.
0,in the first round the application was slightly performing better as compared to the final one. the team may have had troubles while merging and unresolved conflicts lead to error pages for 
0,not able to test as the sign up failed and admin could add users too.
0,hh is able to view all the other house hunters and their contact details which only admin is designated to view. major privacy breach. file well written.
1, admin is able to delete the company which has houses and reactor associated with it. when you try to edit houses associated with such company the add button does not perform any action. where in if you try to edit houses houses get edited successfully. it seems like relation between model and tables is not maintained properly. while creating new houses reactor is asked to enter id of company and reactor these id are back end data with system incremented numbers and not given to user after registration. hence we should restrain displaying such back end information to users. not able to submit inquiry. posting an inquiry and reply to the inquiry is on same page visible to house hunter. with this release team has written file very well and neatly. also provided admin credentials. below are few major team can work upon house hunter can create new company. can not register as reactor search functionality not working. potential buyer functionality not implemented properly. it does not connect houses with potentials buyer. it seem like listing all the buyers.
0,actually all these edge cased list above are not realized at all. and the mapping relationships between the models don work at all. for example when i delete real estate company and i look back to list nothing happened because the company id in the list looks like some random number such as company id which is not appear in the company list. and so does the house list.
0, work fine but could not find inquiries form after logging as an admin.
0,could check the base cases edge cases. also found high similarity of program doc that detailed the requirements with 
0,the edge cases lead to following results. it asks for confirmation before destroying the company. after that the company is deleted even for those with some and houses. unable to test due to failure for reactor sign it asks for confirmation before destroying the house hunter account. unable to test for inquiries due to failure for house hunter sign the system does not allow new reactor or house hunter to sign up for application.
0,models have not been tested. controllers are partially tested.
0,no test cases apart from default test cases.
1,team has written test cases but they need to few more rounds of testing including positive test cases as well as negative test cases.
0,no they did not write the test code.
0,yes i feel the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.
0,some very basic testing is done for controllers nothing in models
0,they have just tested sign controller looks good but model testing in complete.
0,the team thoroughly tested the admin model and controller. the tests for admin performed checks for admin functionality to be able to view the list of houses created by the as well as look up for and house hunters information that are involved in application.
0,yes the code is written in clean and readable way. only one task is handled by each method and in case of multiple tasks function calls have been implemented perfectly. there is no bad naming in this project. code in model and controller looks fine. proper spacing of function and its block is done.
0,the code looks comprehensive to good extent with the usage of clear naming. the naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. no problem with respect to the coding clarity.
1,most of the code follows standards. but i was not able to verify the complex examples like adding house to interest list email when reply is given by reactor as it is not working. in replies controller avoid using class variable and use instance variable.
0,code is well written.
0, the code was very easy to read and follow good coding practices.
0,solid code easy to read.
0,max commits were made on the last day of submission. no no changes are committed in round.
0,commits after the first review by all team members is seen.
1,regular commits were not done. everything was committed in one commit which should be discouraged. think about working professionally you should be committing code asap and committing with proper commits and description. commit also should not be all module at once but individual.
1,yes the team has committed changes in round also. overall it looks like the codes were pushed to master and one go. regularly committing the files could have been better.
0,yes there are commits in phase as well.
0, commits with about commits after round.
0, commits. last one on th oct
0,some of the relationships are handled in the project. i can find the other important association like. company has many houses why it is commented. house belongs to user or company
0,this relation is handled well.
0,db design is not taken care of properly. various mappings between entities have not been established.
1,db seems well designed. i didn see potential buyers. that will have relation with house such that house has many potential buyers.
0,the company house inquiry user etc mapping is done well and according to the 
0,yes all the db relationships are handle properly.
1,there are some which needs to be implemented. areas you should focus on are destroy is not working correctly in some cases application is getting crashed again and again. admin should not be deleted by user. how is house associated with company is something which i was not able to understand.
0,house images look broken. destroying company does not work instead leads to edit company page.
0,reactor can not have no company reactor is forced to join one of the real estate companies. as reactor i can not destroy the company i create and only first real estate company on the index page has navigation buttons. and any reactor can edit the first real estate company which is not own by them. floor number can be negative. house image can only read local images those houses created by other can not be seen. you can not create an account that has both reactor and role. can not send inquiry in house it shows up an error said house must be exist.
0,issues able to create admin accounts. view inquiry is failing for no way to see interested house list.
0,you should restrict the format of the webster of company. after add company i can edit and destroy my own company.
0,first round their login functionality wasnt working it is working now as expected
0,the developers have put in for role selection and company selection making the interface more intuitive. the application broke in hero when i tried to login though it might be hero specific error. the login sign buttons on the landing page don seem to work. in fact none of the buttons seem to work and i am not even getting the hand pointer as you have mentioned in the 
0,as hunter i get view house inquiries button but the system crashes when i click on it.
0,when admin try to delete user the webster return some error. when the admin try to delete real estate company it just redirect to the edit route instead of delete the company
0,here is something which needs to be focused. i can see the association between company and houses. deletion of company by admin is redirecting to and not deleting the company. i not able to view the inquiries too. in most of the views deletion is not working.
1,deleting house hunter does not work possible error in deployment. edge cases company cannon be created without filling all details. this is implemented. session control when user signs out from page and then goes back the profile page should not be shown as he is signed out. this should be considered.
0,destroy does not work at all it will redirect user back to edit page of the object for houses and real estate companies. for users if they have foreign key association with any inquire then you can not delete them.
0,mapping of house to company is missing. reactor company mapping is also missing. destroy feature for house is not working
0, does cover the edge cases.
0,few edge cases not working.
0,the seems incomplete. a lot of information could have been communicated through . as an admin i could delete any of the listed houses or companies which i think should be allowed for the admin.
0,it seems some destroy function have some issue.
0,no this team has not tested any model. the controller tests does not handle all the cases.
0,does not tell about how to run test
0,only auto generated test cases are present
0,spec files are missing from the 
0,none of the controller or model was tested.
0,no test for any of the models
0, commenting was pretty weak in the files i looked through. overall code style looked pretty good though i scanned through the files and nothing caught my eye as poor.
0,from what i can tell code quality in this application is good. functions generally look small and there is good use of rails utilities.
0,code is written properly. one method is covering only one functionality. also for more features team has created new controllers. hence i can conclude code is neat and readable.
0,looks good. there are some files which are misleading like folder has edit company file which is blank. also the file is missing the admin login details.
1,overall code is clean and readable. naming and project structure is consistent with good practices. one issue that stood throughout the code is that authorization is done directly in controller methods. it would be better if this common functionality was moved to separate function call e.g. validating user role in houses controller create method
0,the code is clean.
0,great code writing habit.
0,there are new commits however the quality of commit is terrible. commit message should have short description of what was changed not just be random words like foo foo or 
0,yes team had been pushing changes on continuously with neat commit messages in round also. with commits till now. yes can see last commit on th oct. but commits are not distributed equally.
1,although branching strategy was followed. the commits mostly seem to be made on the second last and last day of submission. it will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.
1,yes changes we committed in round. code commit could have better by committing as soon as possible. committing few files and writing proper comments and description for the commit was missing. as reader i was not able to understand what particular commit meant and what module was changed because there was no proper explanation.
1,the team continued to make changes in round on regular basis. however naming should have been more descriptive. in many cases it is not possible to understand the scope of the commit. one team member work is not reflected in contributors panel. i would suggest fixing this by matching user credentials of local machine and remote server.
0, all the mapping looks good. nice job
0,yes the db design handles these relationships correctly.
0,team has mapped house reactor company also house hunter inquiries well in the model.
0,the schema is very well defined. most of the suggestions provide as part of initial review are incorporated. the relationships are defined correctly and use of dependent destroy ensures that child records are deleted before parent record. this ensures there is consistency.
0,implemented the mappings properly.
0,this system handles all relationships properly by using has many belongs to constructs correctly and addition of relevant foreign key attributes in the appropriate tables.
0,unable to create new house
0, the system now has the basic functionality that was missing last time like logging in. good job on the fixes. it crashed when as reactor i attempted to create house telling me to check the logs for more information if i was the owner. still no information on an admin user listed in the though.
0,there were many missing pieces of functionality. i note them below i was unable to create house as an admin. i get an error when attempting to search for houses. as an admin i was unable to update or create reactor though i could delete them. as an admin i should be able to set the password of reactor or house hunter that is security vulnerability. i was unable to create house hunter as an admin. when signing up as reactor i should be given the list of companies to join before signing up. this is security vulnerability. as reactor i was unable to create new company. as reactor i was unable to list new house.
0,team has worked well compared to last release on ui and tried to cover up all the i still can not see admin credentials in file file only states there will be only one admin in the system. hence can not review admin i am not able to create house using login as well. it seems code only support specific inputs for house creation and am not able to find those specific inputs. hence can not perform many other reviews from house hunter also.
1,admin login details are not present in file. until now. it may be case of wrong file at the last moment. i have looked into the file and got the admin details from there. do make changes in the file. things which needs to be corrected admin should not be able to edit any of his details apart from his name. editing company should only update it which is working fine. the message shown to user says new company is created which is slightly misleading. will be very small message change. creating and viewing houses functionality not working currently. gives application error with message check logs for more details. admin is able to create reactor and house hunter. but once i delete some users and then click on reactor account or house counter account options given on the ui it throws application error same as above. can you explain about about why this buttons are given and what should it exactly do. admin is able to delete himself from users list. this should not be allowed. not able to check potential buyers and interests functionality as admin as creating or view house is not functioning currently. may be you can check the logs. might be small deployment error like get post methods misplaced. for reactor and sign it should be allowed to without specifying company or other details except name email password as per the unease given. this is not allowed currently. no houses are currently present and not able to create new house. it gives the same error as it does with admin login. so not able to test potential buyers interest and deletion for it.
0,nether admin nor reactor able add new houses. unable to send inquiry. no option to delete reactor and hh account
0,admin credentials still not provided in the file. so not able to test any functionality related to admin. creation of new house is failing. so anything related to house module inquiries reply email cannon be tested. as the house cannon be added house interest list module cannon be verified. phone number validation is missing. inquiry module gives error page
0,one major problem is that i am getting an error after adding house as reactor which prevents access to reactor house related features like edit destroy etc. admin credentials are not specified in the i managed to find them in the file. most of the admin functionality is implemented however i am getting an error when accessing new house page rocky sands houses new and so house cannon be added through admin same case with reactor houses data is missing in the system. search functionality is present in the code however i was not able to locate the proper view for that.
0,can not create new house.
0,unable to create houses so could really check any functionality.
0, i don have access to an admin account to test this there were no currently existing houses and i cannon create new one i don have access to an admin account to test this the is still just the default one provided by rails.
0,i was unable to sign up as reactor and house hunter with the same email.
0,team did not provide credentials in file. hence can not check these reactor is allowed to change company but only able to create house hence can not review further functionality. again admin credentials not given and reactor not able to create house.
0,already covered in detail in above question. there are some issues with view and create houses functionality. also deletion of users is working fine but gives error when clicked on or house hunter account button in admin view.
0,made does have admin details.
0,cannon log in as admin so can test deletion of company. reactor is not able to add company. what will happen if reactor changes his her real estate company. not able to add house so can be tested.
1,most of the edge cases pertain to houses inquiries users. this cannon be tested if houses are not present in the system. houses can be added through admin reactor or seed. i would suggest fixing at least admin or reactor functionality or using seed for populating data.
0, the admin model is tested however this seems silly as creation of admin accounts does really matter as it is not possible. they are supposed to be predefined. the admin controller has very extensive list of tests. very good work here.
1,test cases seem to be written neatly. it seems team has spent most of the time on coding i would request team to perform rounds of negative test cases that might help them avoid fail and system credentials. system allows to provide same email id to reactor as well has house hunter but they have also provided role while signing in that distinguishes user who is house hunter and reactor both.
0, controller is tested. but not in detail. it just checks if we can navigate to it.
0,most of the test cases are auto generated.
0,the team has done great job in testing. admin controller is tested extensively with relevant concise comments and spec is used to test admin model with its validators.
0,the code employed good naming and seemed to be dry and follow standard ruby on rails practices. the methods were kept short. would make more sense as each row in the table is one wish list entry not list of wish list entries.
0,every action has different definition written. the code is well structured.
1,code is written properly and followed dry. each function is handling single task. team understands mac architecture very well but could see controller for every functionality where in such could have been handled with mere methods in other main controllers.
0,no bad naming handles multiple tasks with multiple function calls.
0,the code is in general clean and readable. nearly all methods seen handle only one task or use function calls to handle other tasks. naming seems appropriate in all of the files. there are no overly nested blocks.
0,the code is well written.
0,good coding practice followed.
0,the code looks clear and understandable
1,the of interest list and inquiries are implemented in crude way i.e. by creating drop down for listings. it becomes very tedious for the user to go and choose house from hundreds of listings every time to just add it to interest list. a better way would have been by creating an option of adding to the interest list where user can see all the listings. adding user to interest list does not add the buyer to house potential buyer list. there is no option for viewing potential buyers.
1,nicely implemented code. used ruby delegations appropriately and the code is very readable. however few things can be improved. for eg in inquiry replies controller flash is used to transfer data from the new method to the method which is not the correct way. also i believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits. for example in almost all the controllers there are redundant database hits session role type buyer could have been identified during login. a second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided. for small test database this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower. maybe you can store these in memory session. which would reduce time taken significantly at small memory overhead.
0,i could see huge number of commits on the but it is not evenly distributed.
0,submitted changes throughout the project. committed changes in round.
0,the team did good job of making consistent commits throughout the life of the project.
0,history shows lots of commits but major from one teammate only.
0,the team has been submitting regularly however they have committed some of the changes quite after the deadline i.e. th oct
0,the code frequency is pretty good.
1,inquiries and house interest lists should not belong to companies. they belong to houses which belong to companies. also user should not have many companies. this is possible with the database and model configuration. otherwise the relationships were properly implemented.
0,mappings are mentioned appropriately
0,team has handled to and to relationship very cleanly. not only in code but also the related are working great except few. like i can not see reactor associated with any company.
0,i think it does but i don feel confident in my answer.
0,the relation mapping is well made.
0,models show good relation mapping.
1,the reactor can exist without belonging to company this should be corrected as the reactor must belong to company.
0,peak work on few days nothing on the other.
1,the database handles all the relationships very well. on the downside there is flaw in database design keeping single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both reactor and house hunter profiles. you can either create separate tables or more than one columns to determine if the same email has more than one role.
0,since the app threw an exception on the homage and was unusable this score reflects what was achieved in round. basic passing corresponds to or four stars. the screenshots in the only demonstrated definitively features that were working in the last version.
0,the reactor cannon select an existing company and cannon see the list of the companies. house hunter cannon see companies
1,basic are working fine except few. team could work on below . system crashes when reactor tries to create house. house hunter can create company. when clicked on show company system crashes. passwords are visible.
1,user cannon sign up as both reactor and hunter no role switching.
0,the system is in great shape. it is easily one of the best i have seen and they still didn implement all of the expected functionality.
0,issues are fixed but creating house from reactor account breaks in hero i am unable to create an account which has same email address for reactor and buyer. reactor does not have choose company input field to choose his reactor company.
0,the role switch option between reactor and is not present. further the operation cannon be performed manually also as same mail id cannon be used for creating two accounts.
1,since the first round authors seem to have progressed lot and added most of the missing however following are some of them i found is no potential buyer list for house that can be viewed by reactor however there is link to the house inquiries. i am not able to associate company to my profile as reactor the reactor should be able to work for only one company however here i am able to add multiple companies which should be restricted to admin only. admin unable to login to the system as admin
0,several are working however few of them are still not. the list is provided below a reactor can not see houses which do not have images attached. a reactor can not reply to specific inquiry and should not be able to edit inquiries. reactor and cannon register by same email id. admin cannon view all houses or inquiries. a reactor is able to post houses of any companies not just the company he belongs to. a reactor can not choose the company he belongs to. reactor can not see buyers even when the buyer has put the house in interest list.
0,for the same reason edge cases passing corresponds to or three stars. the was very detailed.
0,above listed test cases were handled.
1,if admin tries to delete company corresponding houses gets deleted. similarly association between inquiry and other models handled well. system goes into error when we try to create house without images though houses gets created multiple times. login team could probability add null check for empty references.
0,handles all edge cases.
1, as far as i can tell an admin cannon delete real estate company. don appear to have real estate companies. house hunters do not seem to be able to make inquiries. the does not document any edge cases.
1,there is no functionality to edit reactor company.
0,everything explained in works great.
0,the file is properly illustrated but it does not include how the system handles edge cases. the relationship between reactor and company is not properly implemented.
0, it seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality as i am not able to sign in as an admin with the provided credentials thus i am unable to test this edge case due to missing functionality of reactor being associated to company i am unable to test this edge case. it seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality as i am not able to sign in as user there is no potential buyer list hence cannon test this edge case.
0,very well implemented. all edge cases i tried are working. does not detail how the system handles edge cases.
0,could not find file in which tests are done neither is it specified in 
0,the test cases seem to have no additional test cases other than those automatically generated during scaffold some of the potential missing tests include testing the role based access given to reactor as he is able to create multiple companies.
0,the testing was incomplete the model and controller were not thoroughly tested.
0,rose file found but is empty.
0, no model is tested. home controller test appears to be thorough.
0,all meaningful tests
1,test cases written and system is checked and positive testing is done properly. team could perform one round of testing and solve minute errors still present.
0,only basic scaffold tests could be found in the test folder and the spec folder did not have any tests. the did not indicate where the tests were or if there were any.
0,yes to and to relationships properly are handled properly. tables are mapped properly too. i don find any issue related to db.
0,the corresponding ruby files maintain the belongs to and has many relationships to reflect this
0,potential buyers interest house and inquiry dependencies are not handled properly.
0, in the model classes and schema file each object has good relationship with each other.
0,many and n relations mapped incorrectly and they cause application crash. code does not use dependent destroy delete when two related is deleted houses
0,there is to relationship between company and 
0,the system handles the to and to relationships properly. the real estate company and reactor relationship mapped as to n.
0,the db design is incomplete. although it has the correct to or to relationship it does have any kings of validation.
0,all the basic have been implemented. team as whole have worked really hard to make common functionality work.
1,the necessary are implemented. the file explains how to access some of these also. however the company listings appear even before the reactor chooses company. this should happen
1,there was no functionality implemented during st review. so there is drastic improvement. however there are some which need further improvements. admin has no option to post or view houses. admin is not able submit inquiry or reply to inquiries. admin has no option currently to edit his profile. he should be able to edit his name. multiple and house hunters can be created with the same email id. there is no email or role validation. this will allow lot of duplicate entries and the app will also be susceptible to attacks by robots. can be improved by line validation code in model. password should be encrypted. while entering the details too it should not be displayed as plain text. can be improved by simply using type as password instead of text in views. and applying encryption in model so that password is encrypted throughout the application search house functionality does not work when new house is created. it shows the same old results. also the description specifies search by price range. but it has only one field to input price. this won work if the user wants to see house which is between to bucks or any house which is less then bucks. since the app shows only houses greater then the price entered. reactor is able to create house even if he is not associated with company. reactor is able to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries for all houses without being associated to company. there should be check to ensure that reactor is able to post house only if he is associated with company. also the option to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries should only be enabled for houses which are associated with his company. in case of no company association he should be to associate himself with company or create new company first.
0,as house hunter i am not
0,reactor can view all houses posted. reactor can create house post without join any company. add picture button is under company instead of house and it is not working. house can have negative floor numbers. house search function only shows the first match result instead of all. as you can edit any company which is not allow.
0,admin cannon see houses inquiries list of does display company information list of house hunter does not display all information
0,fixed users can log in and log out admin can create view house hunters companies users can edit his her profile potential buyers functionality implemented inquiry functionality implemented issues admin cannon create houses house hunters can edit real estate companies
0,the system performs almost all the that are described as part of the deliverable one specific issue that was suggested and resolved was mapping the reactor to real estate company.
0,the can edit the company which is odd.
0,the system does check all edge cases. a reactor can see company listings even without choosing company. the does not outline exactly how all edge cases are handled
1,along with the above improvements some of the things you might want to take care of are even if company is deleted the houses and inquires remain as it is. partial reason is the above bug which allows to create house and post reply without being associated to any i try to delete house it shows application error. so not able to test if dependent child records for potential buyers and house hunters are deleted or not. for reactor and sign it should be allowed to sign without specifying company or other details except name email password as per the unease given. this is not allowed currently.
0, you can not destroy any real estate company reactor or as admin with any reactor house or inquire it will just throw an error. you can have negative floors for house. file does not tell anything about edge cases.
0,what will happen if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses. app crashes what will happen if admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries. app crashes
0, after the admin deletes company its associated houses are not deleted. who don have company can still post listing view edit other companies listing and also send receive inquires.
0,when try to delete user with inquiry it return some error.
1,test is implemented only for model. no test is implemented for controllers.
0,the admin is tested. the user model is not completely tested. only the admin functionality is implemented
0,only the default tests are present. no custom tests to test model admin as mentioned in file. it might me that the code is not yet committed.
0,corner cases like removing house from interest list have not been tested
0,the team has not written many test cases to thoroughly tested one model and one controller.
0,inquiries controller and interests controller are tested no models are tested
0,the team has thoroughly tested each model and controller and the tests were performed to check reactor functionality works as described.
0,thoroughly test the admin model
0,well written and able to follow. however i see no branches created and hence pull requests merged. all work is pushed direct to master.
0,seems alright.
1,all methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. good job. could have named the methods and variables little better. each function performs single task. every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if.
0,yes the code written was clean and readable
0,code quality is good linked features are working fine like the one asked in question.
1,project name could have been better. methods were kept small. comments were left out in some controllers views. if else blocks were properly indented in some cases. hard coded numbers were used for comparisons. a better way is to create representing different values such as roles and using those in code. this way something like if role becomes if role reactor and thus is more clear.
0,good code writing.
0,good coding practices have been followed. methods are crisp and single responsibility paradigm has been implemented.
0,submitted well within deadline.
0,yes they did.
0,the team committed their changes throughout the project period consistently.
0,yes the team has committed code changes in round
1,they added few changes could ve listed more on 
0,yes they still until yesterday.
0,yes the team kept committing changes throughout the duration of the project.
0,all dependencies are well and designed. every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. your team is pro. reactor to house and house to company other relationships are implemented.
0,yes the relationships are handled properly company multiple etc. no mapping table as such the schema handles it
0,reactor house inquiry relationship deleting should delete houses and inquires. interests should have been defined on the user model. company has many users hunter does belong to company. with such relationship was hunters could be associated to company by editing request before post request to create users.
0,they missed some relation such as house and inquires relation.
0,relationship between user and company is vague. there is separate reactor accounts table. so users seems to be house hunters. and house hunter does not need to have relationship with company.
1,i was able to post house without any data filled in form. house got created successfully. likewise for company. phone number validation missing in sign up. sort by soft price and floors are failing going to error page applying price range filter and clicking once is giving expected result. clicking on it again is resetting the filter. could try to retain the applied filter on the select option. when i tried to view non existent house manually by changing example calm forest <> house lists i got the default ruby error screen the page you were looking for does exist. could do redirect to browse page calm forest <> house lists tried to update an old inquiry. got new page that says invalid access as well as inquiry was successfully updated.
0,min can still be greater than max in house filter
0,i did not find any problems in the first phase testing. all basic work as expected. bonus points for the ui. one of the best i have seen. the web application is intuitive and guides the user in performing any function. great job.
0,most of the are implemented but i am not able to login as an admin using username password combination mentioned in 
0,yes most of the required features are working fine. some errors are there like admin is able to add interest to houses which is an unintended feature as admin should change role before doing that.
0,first reviews comments were fixed.
0,they still have the problem i found in the first round.
0,the issues reported are fixed. admin account can be deleted from the user listing.
0,when searching for house type some location hit filter then sort by year. found like this calm forest <> house lists authenticity token bi fb dl g pdb a does f f ra ri g on d d commit filter id search form method get sort build year low e c passing sensitive info like authenticity token in para is dangerous. also is it required. when viewing interested users of particular house what the point of the para user id. calm forest <> <>se list id user id calm forest <> <>se list id user id
0, file does explain anything
0,when the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses all the houses and are deleted as well. this is the expected functionality. good job. all other test cases work as well. if house hunter is deleted all of his her inquiries are also deleted.
0,i could not login as admin using username password combination provided in so edge cases could not be tested.
0,the document clearly mentions the edge cases when company is deleted what happens to the houses and 
0,edge cases like real estate company deletion are handled as deletions which is basically not handling it. could ve done some case like transferring them to other user account or such.
0,house search not working able to keep fields like price blank during new house creation i was getting inquiry invalid access on replying to an inquiry but it did save to the database. high low links in houses table for reactor admin was able to add to interest list admin able to reply to queries hunter should have contact method authentication not applied throughout the app calm forest companies accessible without login
0,they did not very well dealing with the edge happens.
0,edge cases are covered. when company is deleted the and houses are also deleted along with it. the file also details how the edge cases are handled.
0,able to create two users with same email. and if i try to login with that particular email error screen appears.
0,not thoroughly test. not enough test written for inquiries
0,models and controllers are well tested. all edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. the inquiries controller is especially well tested. all assert statements are well thought of.
0,yes. the team has thoroughly tested.
0,the test only validates cases with valid attributes
0,most common cases are tested in controllers. they are using fixtures for testing
0,yes they used respect to test the code.
0, commits. quite impressive.
1,the code has been implemented as per the ruby standards of coding. however the author has used numeric ids for role comparison which is difficult to map with the code. it would have been more meaningful if the author could use the names of role so that it could be easily understood. also it could be more easier for the reader if the author could avoid lot of commented code. specially in main classes such as instance from code for point if current current else current 
1,all methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. good job. could have named the methods and variables little better. each function performs single task. every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if else conditions.
0,adopted good coding practices
1,instead of writing role. it would have cleaner if some constants were defined. then role admin would have been much clearer the create method in users controller is very big and contains several if else statements. it should have been broken down into several sub methods like create reactor or create house hunter i did not find any user in any
0,code was very clear and concise. implemented concepts of cohesion and coupling. related were placed together.
0,yes the code looks good. code principles are followed didn find any major code duplication issues.
0,the code is very well written with maximum covered including adding house to interest list as hunter and showing that hunter as potential buyer for that particular house. well done.
0,the code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task. i could not understand the reason for some of the code like the home action in the hunters controller the current user role is set to without any checks. so if the is visited directly and user role is something else it will be set to and saved which can result in wrong behaviours. overall code is well written
0,yes timely commits
0,yes. the team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. the team even kept pushing commits during round. also all team mates seemed to have contributed equally.
0,the team has been using for almost entire tenure of the project. yes the team has made multiple changes during the round. the team has been making changes after the code submission as well till today date.
0, commits in round
0,team showed great consistency in committing changes. changes increased in round.
0,yes the commit count has almost doubled.
0, commits. the team seems to be quite active throughout.
0,code is pushed but frequency is very less.
0,yes. models are maintained properly.
0,yes the team has handled all the single and multiple associations among all entities quite well. all the relationships can be reviewed under the model of all the entities.
0,database was well designed so as to avoid redundancy.
0,looks good. all types of relationships are handled properly.
0,yes. the mapping of to for company reactor and company houses is correctly done.
0,the design is well implemented. relationships are well defined in models and edge cases are handled in schema itself.
0,the application has almost all of the basic including pictures functionality however the below fails a house hunter is able to see the companies and edit them as well. a reactor can create houses without adding any details at all.
0,the house hunter page is not working. i logged in as reactor and then switched to house hunter view. i was not able to see any house list any interest list send inquiry form etc. deducted points for that. no filter function.
0,following errors home page cannon be accessed after logging in as admin. sign for reactor is not working sign for hunter is not working home page is not showing up after g in as reactor cannon as reactor with the credentials given in the 
0,admin cannon delete users deleting house hunter crashes the app no validation present in any models eg houses real estate company admin cannon delete houses
0,system works well except for the sign up feature.
0,almost of the features are covered. dual role implementation is missing not working. sign does give an option to register as both reactor and hunter at the same time. input validations are not handled. remove from interest list option is missing ideally once the user clicks on add to interest list button the button should be changed to remove from interest list. admin didn have the delete option for all the users listed this needs to be fixed. a reactor was not given an option to edit the details of the house he she has listed only photo adding feature was there.
1,there are several improvements over the last review. have been implemented which make huge improvement to the ease of use of the system. while the ui has become lot better there are several flaws admin is shown to be registered as reactor but cannon be redirected to the pages link works. can set another hunter interest list by manipulating id. can edit companies. admin cannon destroy users admin can not create edit destroy reactor error page is shown. reactor can list houses even if not enrolled in company admin can not destroy . passwords are visible to admin. there are few minor problems which if dealt with would make code even better proper error while signing up with wrong password length hero error shows up which makes it feel like the functionality in working whereas the problem can be user fault as they could have entered only digit pin. let users know that they need to provide proper input. also please do not ask passwords in text field. a very simple change can go long way.
0,the system seemed to handle test cases.
0,the file is very helpful and facilitates usage of the application. there are few issues which can still be resolved such as the navigation issue still persists for example if house hunter wants to cancel the inquiry there is no way to do that. the user would be between the inquiry index page and the inquiry submit page. the validations have still not been addressed for example an inquiry can be created without adding any details at all with all empty fields. if the house hunter tries to switch to the reactor view the application breaks as below we re sorry but something went wrong. if you are the application owner check the logs for more information.
0,when the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses all the houses and are deleted as well. this is the expected functionality. good job. all other test cases work as well.
0, admin deletes real estate company not tested reactor sign in sign not working inquiries not visible for 
0,the does not cover how the system handles edge cases. what will happen if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses. system deletes the company but the app crashes when accessing the reactor account. what will happen if reactor changes his her real estate company. will he be prohibited to remove the houses he listed in the previous company. there is no validation at all and there is no way to have reactor without company. if this house hunter is potential buyer of house will he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list app crashes
0,edge cases are well handled with the appropriate handling of dependencies between companies and users houses and their creators etc.
0, what will happen if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses. houses got deleted and reactor got assigned with some other random company. what will happen if reactor changes his her real estate company. will he be prohibited to remove the houses he listed in the previous company. house also got changed to reactor new company. what will happen if the admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries. will the inquiries be automatically deleted. cascade delete is in place.
0,when company is deleted by the admin the reactor profile belonging to that company crashes.
1,i could not check if most of the edge cases work. all the ways i tried doing this failed admin cannon destroy most of the users admin cannon view edit destroy admin was unable to destroy account i created it was also registered as reactor acc when destroyed the company associated houses were also destroyed and their associated inquiries and replies were deleted so that edge case has been taken care of. i believe that maybe all the cases are taken care of but i could not test them as their dependent are not working.
0,test cases for the user have been implemented.
0,the team has not implemented any test cases for any of the entities.
0,models and controllers are well tested. all edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. the user model is especially well tested.
0,test for user model is done. one test for static pages controller is done.
0,only basic controller tests have been provided
0,testing was done.
1,model testing needs to be improved with more scenarios.
0,could find any testing done for any controller. model user was thoroughly tested.
0,could not find the test file and neither is it mentioned in the 
0, codes looks clean but there are no deployed version of the project.
0,the code is written in clean way
0,two names for the company references creates confusion company id re company id
1,the methods seem like the ones created by the scaffold command. even for the views there in any code for eg. to display house delete only to the reactor who has created it.
0,validations are not implemented in all the models.
0,the quality of the code is good clean and well readable. multiple tasks are handled by function calls and method handles only one task. there is not many nested blocks or long methods. there is no bad naming in this project and is well organised.
0,there are two git links given not sure which one to review. so reviewing the one which has more commits. major are not implemented so cannon comment on this. naming are properly given as per the rails standard.
0,clean and nice code. but lack of 
0, there are no any submission for round.
0,i see big commit with all the files which is the first commit and very small other commits done in round.
0,there are some commits around hrs ago. most commits are days prior.
0,compared to other teams that i have reviewed there are fewer commits here and some are recently committed on oct.
1,the team did not seem to submit their changes throughout the project. the team have made changes only after round and nothing on round. there are total of commits. it would have been better if the commits have been made with messages so that others can know what changes have been made in the project.
1,not every member of team contributed. could see some commits after the deadline of round.
0, commits total. only one user contribute to it.
0, relationship looks good in both models and schema.
0,yes all relationships properly defined in the model
0,the db is well designed and relationship mappings are proper.
0,this application handles and n relationships properly. company reactor has relationship in the mapping table. i could not find any problem related to relationships.
0,no schema or relations are implemented.
0,all db relation and validation are correct and complete. good job.
0,can run the application.
0, there are no deployed version of the project file does not give any help and i tried to download it and run it locally it is not working.
0,link to deployed application is not given.
1,interest list has not been implemented. please write file in your repo to let us know the admin credentials please provide the deployment link
0,houses can still be deleted by anyone and not just the reactor who posted the listing. the application link to hero or any other deployment link in given. is not properly updated.
0, there is no admin account no roles assigned to any users any users can edit delete another user of potential buyer admin missing or incorrect.
0,the hero link to this project has not been submitted. so i am not able to check if the system works as it is supposed to work. but through the link the code seems legible. without the hero link i am not able to check if there is any functionality is missing or not.
0,only the skeleton of the project is implemented all major features are absent.
0, no login or sing to no authorization for the user basically any one can do anything in this system. no picture function no search function no reply for the inquiry.
0, can not test 
0,please provide the deployment link
1, does not mention anything with respect to edge cases. the linking is not intuitive. you have provided back buttons in quite few places which redirect to that entities page instead of redirecting to the actual page i came from. suggestion is put in button for menu and link the menu to the starting page of the currently logged in entity. this will make things simpler.
0,the project is implemented incorrectly and is incomplete.
0,the file has not been updated hence it does not provide the instructions regarding this system. it does not mention how the system handles the edge cases. since there is no hero link given i cannon test the system for edge cases and also the file does not specify any details.
0,no users or other features.
0,when delete user with inquiry data the system crush and return an error.
0, no testing mentioned in file.
0,no. edge cases not tested.
0,only ba
0,the tests are the normal ones generated by scaffold.
0,tests are written for the controllers.
0,the team has tested controller but not model.
0,no test cases are implemented.
0,no model has been tested.
0,the commits were regularly till round.
0,i could see commits in round as well.
0,yes. commits
0,yes the team kept pushing their updates even in round
0,fewer commits compared to other teams that i have reviewed.
0,the team has contributed to the repo regularly. all the team members have contributed to the project in the second phase. the system has improved lot as compared to the previous version.
0,yes lot of code has been checked in post st cut
0,no mapping table was found.
0,there is no association between models.
0,since the last time they have improved lot. the basic functionality are working.
1,admin has separate login and cannon login from the same page as other users. admin panel could be made little more user friendly by separating links on different lines.
0,admin requires separate to login.
0,while signing up as reactor or all fields are not present. only username and password is being asked.
1,basic are working in the sense that able to add users but many features are missing. unable to use same email id for reactor and admin is not able to edit house records reactor cant view other real estate company info not there for any house therefore it invalidates many requirements
1,certain test cases are not possible to test due to the way edit reactor is implemented. the webster takes real estate company id and not name for update. being user i would know the company id and hence won be able to perform the right test
1,the basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine. it does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above but some of the validations i tried seem to have worked.
1,deleting company does delete it houses. no form of cascade delete present anywhere.
1,many normal cases are failing as told in previous case hence the edge cases specified are not even applicable
1,unfortunately most of the test cases failed while testing the reactor does not get deleted from the system after the deletion of his her respective real estate company. the link to create new houses redirect to different link hence i was not able to create new houses and test certain cases the inquiries submitted by the house hunter remain in the database even after the deletion of the house hunter all the inquires of the particular house are shown to every reactor which is not an ideal case these are some of the cases that need attention. owing to the work done on remainder of the project these changes would be implemented easily with some effort
1,few issues that i found were. different for different type of users. how does reactor switch roles between user and reactor
0,as mentioned in the read me file the inquiry controller and the admin model have been tested thoroughly
0,no model or controller has been tested.
0,they ve tested one controller thoroughly and one basic feature of admin model is tested
0,admin model has only two tests.
0,the user and reactor roles are tested to prevent any abnormal occurrences during the sign up. good work on that.
0,tests are too few for models. integration tests missing
0,the code is very well structured and written with good coding practice.
0,the code quality is fairly standard. the code does follow good ruby and rails coding practices. no bad naming. every file is properly named based on their i cannon find issues with coding. one method handles only one task. i could not find any bugs in the system and this works exactly how it is supposed to work.
0,code is written in an efficient clean and readable manner. proper use of data structures like hash maps are used wherever necessary. a proper use of names for controllers migrations and views can be seen. the names given for controllers properly signifies the tasks performed. the file is thorough and provides all the implemented in the project
1,project name could have been better
0,every method is handling only one task and the code is written in clean and readable manner. the naming conventions are maintained. the code was also very modular. the overall gui is user friendly.
0,the code is written clearly.
0,commits on the repo show updates of 
0,yes the commits were very well spread out throughout the development cycle which was evident from the quality of the project that was delivered.
0,checking git log the team kept submitting their changes throughout the project.
0,yes the team kept on submitting changes throughout the project. the commits also includes messages and descriptions about the changes made. the team still committed changes in round.
0,the team has worked hard on the project which is evident by the fact that i can see commits almost daily throughout the project period. an excellent job on that end.
1,the commits were spread throughout the project duration however the commit messages could have been more descriptive. the team still made commit changes in round which shows they have proceeded with development.
0,they keep commit code until.
0,all known mappings are present
0,the db was very well designed and successfully mapped all the required relations effectively.
0,this system handles the and n relationships properly. the relationships have been set up properly in the model files as well as the schema. they have also implemented the destroy dependency in the model hence no error pops out when the parent record is deleted.
0,the team has done praise worthy work in handling relationships in the system. the real estate company can add multiple as well as the authorization of particular reactor changes with the change in company.
1,user model does have all has many relations defined
0, and n relationships are all properly defined between company and users.
0,they added to and to relationship in the model.
0,all working with great ui.
0,yes the system worked almost perfectly and there was huge improvement from the first round. almost all the issued pointed out after the first round were successfully resolved especially the bug fixing part and adding the new features. the user experience was also considerably improved throughout the application.
1,most are working great. in the first round admin was missing some basic now they are present and working. one issue that i came across is that while admin is creating new company the system keeps raising an error saying that the webster is invalid and so the users cannon create new company. maybe there is something wrong with the validations of company model. however when reactor creates the company this error does not occur.
0,the inquiry form is not working
0,the system works without any glitches. the team has been fixing bugs after the review such that it works clean now. i could not find any functionality that is still failing even after trying the edge cases.
1,the casebook sign which was working in the previous sign up works properly. the admin reactor customer are working fine and i can see lot of improvement from the previous version. the reactor can send receive queries by the customer. however small suggestion would be to ask reactor for the company name while filling the sign up form. apart from that the system all the requirements of the project
0,reactor not able to remove their own company from profile back button missing from some reactor reactor was able to updated query content
1,most of the are implemented. however not valid error message is prohibiting from editing companies under even when given valid . not able to house hunter from the users list through admin login. the following error message is displayed. we re sorry but something went wrong. if you are the application owner check the logs for more information. unload picture ui could have been constructed better because the picture does not fit in the given space.
0,yes but i find small bug the admin can edit his profile and select change his role to reactor although his role did not change there is no error report.
0,checked on few tests tuned out to be handled. if an admin deletes either house company user all the dependencies are deleted.
0, works perfectly fine the reactor is able to remove previous houses. works like charm enquiries are not auto deleted
0,edge cases handled well.
0,could not test inquiry form
0, if the admin deletes company all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any reactor if the reactor changed his or her company the reactor cannon make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. so they will not be able to edit add or remove the houses listed in previous company. if the house hunter is deleted by the admin all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. however the does not cover how the system handles all these edge cases.
0,all the edge cases pass. well done.
0,when an admin deletes real estate company which has and houses the company gets is getting deleted along with the which is not the expected functionality because can exist even without being part of company. the reactor should not get deleted from the database. could not test whether the inquiries are deleted if the house hunter is deleted because the admin is unable to delete house hunter from the users list.
0,the and houses will also be deleted. nothing will happen. inquires will also be deleted.
0,every functionality is working
0,the application seems to have been well tested. almost all of the test cases have been appropriately and effectively written. could find bugs while testing the application too.
0,the team has tested parts of different models and controllers partially but none of the models controllers is thoroughly tested for complete functional verification
0,did not use spec but team has done testing.
0,the team has tested model where user with email and first name should be valid to sign up or sign in. the following tests are meaningful and have the potential to fail when user uses same email to register twice. should not save user with password less than chars. should not save user with invalid email should not save user without email
0,the code shows that most of the controllers and models were tested.
0,yes they have tested model and controller.
1, the search method is little long. some of it could have been extracted to function calls. otherwise the code looks good. methods were short and names were sensible.
1,code looks clean and neat. ui design looks very good and is elegant. search functionality for the houses should have been in controllers and not in the model.
0,excellent code. very well commented and followed most of the ruby standard code format very well organized.
0,neat code and well arrangement of the views especially the house style view.
0,code was committed throughout the project and during second round too.
0,the team committed changes in round. however the changes were not consistently committed throughout the project period.
0,yes committed are constantly updated till today. file was updated hours ago.
0,although the relationships have been properly handled i see in places with belongs to relationship optional true option is present which allows violation of the relationship and is bad idea.
0,the schema file should be in the repo. from the models and the migrations the relationships appeared to be correct.
1,db relationships looked fine. new model was created for house style which could have been parameter in house model itself.
0,can login as admin in the rename flie.
0,the admin credentials provided don work and hence no admin functionality can be tested.
0,an exception occurred when replying to an inquiry. an inquiry could not be deleted by house hunter.
0,basic working fine.
0,all works and can be successfully implemented.
0,can not login as an admin
0, what will happen if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses. can be tested. what will happen if reactor changes his her real estate company. will he be prohibited to remove the houses he listed in the previous company. no reactor is still allowed to delete houses. what will happen if admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries. will the inquiries be automatically deleted. if this house hunter is potential buyer of house will he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list. cannon be tested delete house in house hunter interest list and see if it still appears there. works as expected
1, the reactor could only remove the houses he or she created regardless of his or her company. the was not very specific on how to handle edge cases.
0,good instructions provided. working fine.
0,deletes. changes all cases works.
0,the tests for the controllers and models were basic scaffold tests with not much meaning.
0,good test cases written.
0,models are not tested and controllers are partially tested.
1, sparse on comments describing functionality. otherwise overall code quality is good i did not see any glaring issues.
0,user model could have been subdivided into different roles models such as reactor and 
0,the code has been written in very clean and readable way. it is very legible and properly indented. i could not find and issues with the coding. there is no bad naming in this project and is neatly organised with instructions. one method handles only one specific task. there are function calls for multiple tasks. yes adding the user to the house potential buyers is done by separate method call. on the whole the code quality is legit and i could not spot any long methods or too many nested blocks.
0,this project is very well organized and the code style is great.
0,it good to have the search logic in the model as opposed to the controller.
0, really good commit record with good comments as to what was changed.
0,yes the number of commits have increased upto commits.
0,yes the team kept on submitting their changes throughout their project. there are total of commits from the team and they still committed changes in round. they have made commits int the week of oct which is after the first round. they have committed the changes with proper messages also.
0,i just see commits done on last few days by most teammates.
0,this team kept committing through the end of the project.
0,they have actively committed code during the project duration including round.
0, mapping checks out.
0,there is one to many relationship between user and company. a reactor model is not applied.
0,house hunter and reactor can easily switch accounts.
0,all of the relationships are handled properly in the code.
0,the entity relationships have been established properly. they have also implemented cascading delete.
0,image not showing with listed houses. admin cannon view list of potential buyers. house hunter also asked for company. house hunter has the ability to add houses and list companies. this should not happen.
0,well done. most of the functionality i commented on last time has been fixed with very intuitive ui. the only thing i could find still was being able to view all inquiries as an admin. very good updates overall.
0,search is not working in reactor i did not see any spec in spec folder. while signing up it takes password less than length. when reactor adds the property it does not appear in property list.
1,fixed problems users can edit their name now. admin can create select only one and change companies. they can edit their own company information. admin can view list houses and edit destroy houses that belongs to his her company. can switch roles to house hunter. house hunters can view add companies info. inquiries functionality is implemented. issues houses do not show if they have basement or not. after an inquiry is sent the app redirect to an error page. looks like house hunters can add company houses too. these tasks should have been restricted.
0,the search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round. the authors fixed all of it for round. the system works exactly how it is supposed to work. i could not find any that are still failing. they have added additional features like signing up with and sending replies to enquiries via email.
0,search feature is not working. also i didn find any way to add pictures of the new houses.
0,this system has almost all needed functionality but it by far the best i ve seen. replying to an inquiry does not seem to work properly.
0,all feedback has been fixed. no pending issues.
0,when user is deleted the inquiry remains.
0,all of these are well handled and documented in the good work.
0,hh could not add inquiry
1,when the admin deletes real estate company which has some and houses he can no longer view the list of other house hunters and users. the view button redirect to an error page. admin was able to view hunters users before any deletion happened. after the above step it seems that admin is unable to view users and hunters. so admin cannon delete any users and hunters.
1, if the admin deletes company all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any reactor if the reactor changed his or her company the reactor cannon make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. so they will not be able to edit add or remove the houses listed in previous company. if the house hunter is deleted by the admin all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. the covers how the system handles all these edge cases.
0,the edge cases are covered. the file also details how these cases are handled.
0,still have lots of tests across all of the models and controllers but nothing super extensive that attempts to cover all possible cases.
1,the user model and controller has been tested. it does not test whether the system handles the case that user uses the same email to register twice.
1,the team has tested both model and controller. the system can handle the following cases when user uses same email to register twice. should not save user with password less than chars. should not save user with invalid email should not save user without email
0,the user model is tested as are multiple controllers.
0,they have written proper test cases that check both positives and negatives.
0,the code looks clean and neat. could find any bad naming in the project.
0,code is written properly with all dry principles. methods are simple and clean. every method contains functions specific mac are created where they are needed.
0,yes the code quality seems good. team has taken care of keeping good design.
0,naming convention followed code is neat. formatting is done. function calls are included.
0,
0,the code was committed throughout the project. the code was committed in the second round too.
1,team continuously pushing changes into i could not see distribution of work done equally. i could see commits with neat and easy to understand file.
0,yes the team has shown proper team collaboration two members of the team kept submitting the changes throughout the projects. and there are sufficient commits for round.
0,db relations are handled properly but dependent destroy is not mentioned because which there are issues when destroying entries which have foreign key dependency.
0,team has tried very well to associate relationship between models. it can be seen implemented but thats also causing system crash when conditions not met.
0,yes model and relationships are well designed and cover most of them.
0,foreign key integration is been done in db but as there are no separate active records for user types hunter reactor admin hence the many etc relations are absent.
0,destroy not working unable to create user from admin
0,inquiry part seems to be bit confusing. the reply messages showed on the page is confusing. displaying the message that error is occurring on hero but email has been sent does look good.
1,team has tried very well to fix the problems from first release and succeeded partially. errors and form validations are still not specific. below are few basic team could work upon. house hunter is able to create and edit company as well as houses. admin can create users but no passwords.
0, logged in as house hunter i can edit house which should not be allowed. logged in as house hunter i can edit the company which should not be allowed. founded the company year can be any numeric value logged in as house hunter i can destroy house which should not be allowed logged in as house hunter i can destroy company which should not be the case year built this field in house table for year takes any numerical value
0,search for houses is missing while submitting inquiry the system errors out but that has been documented. this was also pointed out in earlier review
1,ui for new house needs improvement. forms need to be more precise rather than adding many radio buttons as in the case for new house. ui for inquiry reply needs to be more clear.
1,admin. admin can not see all the inquiries by house hunters. search feature not interest interest list feature not implemented. even hunter can post an ad of house and create company missed implementation of basic checks on user roles. the inquiry is not associated with the house separate tab is given with generic form where the hunter has to select reactor and that is failing when clicked on submit maybe hero record of submitted inquiries. relator. seeing potential buyers not view reply not post houses for any user i.e under any company and under any reactor or hunter many have not been implemented if nameless everglades the link they have submitted for round.
0,unable to create company from admin
0,inquiries were mapped to houses. dependent destroy missing in companies for houses hence getting an error when trying to delete companies which have houses. admin is able to add users but they were not able to sign in as they are not created with default password but just added to the users table.
0,team has tried well to cover up edge but still can work on below measures. if we try to delete an entity associated with other entity system crashes. i can not see company field associated with reactor while creating reactor inquiry functionality is difficult to understand. as mentioned in it does go into error but did not receive any mail for it. also i can not see inquiry associated with house. we can unload image but image is visible as id and not as image when viewing the house. potential buyer functionality not working. search house functionality not working.
0, the admin can delete the house hunter that has an inquiry but the inquiry is still available. reactor is able to edit and update company which is not listed by him her. reactor is able to edit and update the house that is not listed by him her. reactor is able to destroy house that is not listed by him her.
0, does not talk about edge cases but it covers how to to access the webster good thing is that most of the errors pointed out in the prior review have been taken care of. search is missing
0,admincan only delete company which has no users hunters else he is unable to delete cannon change his company and can post an ad under any user. house hunter inquiry feature is absent hence could not test this test case.
0,test cases present for user controller.
1,test cases are written very well and system is tested well till some extend but many small cases needs to still handled.
0,integration tests don cover authentication
0,basic functional test cases are written for four controllers.
0,the code has been implemented as per the ruby standards of coding.
0,the code is written in clean and readable way.
0,the team has written code in clean and readable manner. the team has implemented individual functions for handling specific individual tasks. the application uses proper naming convention and follows singular naming convention for all model classes. the team has used singular and plural naming convention as per the standard ruby on rails convention which makes it easier for the reviewer to be able to read and understand the code.
0,proper naming standards and conventions are followed.
0,code seems clean.
0,the code is clean and file is also present explaining each and every implementation
1,code mostly follows good styling guidelines but there are couple of issues. i would suggest splitting nouns when naming classes e.g. instead of . spacing is inconsistent in some classes controller search and houses controller show. there are some cases when decomposition and moving functionality into separate method would make sense. for example in search method of controller class if statements could be moved to separate method with descriptive name. this would make code more readable. there are instances where code is commented out e.g. controller removing that commented chunk entirely would make code cleaner. deleted chunk could always be referenced in git history.
0,one method handle one task and code is neat and understandable
1,with total of about commits the team has made more or less periodic commits. labels for the commits could be better so it becomes more readable
1,the team has well documented history of commits. the team has been regular in updating the repository. the team has kept on updating the repository through both the periods of the submission. the team also has used proper commit messages to document the commit history. the file has also been updated regularly and contains detailed report on the associated with each user role. also the testing information has been updated on the repository. the team could have added information on how the tests can be run. the team could have added information on how to setup the environment after cloning the repository and what all dependency information is associated with the application. the file could have been more structured with proper titles and paragraphs.
0,yes there are commits after round review but by review the project was working and hence these commits are probably partially to make it work in the first place.
0,well written code clean and easy to read.
1,i really appreciate the organization of your code. everything is grouped in appropriate folders and easy to navigate. i also like how most of your code is indexed and spaced. great readability. functions are clearly written to handle exactly what the name indicates. there are few places where the continuation of parameters should be realigned examples company in companies controller and format of webster in company model. overall great use of ruby styling standards.
1,short methods good. project structure good. i feel you haven committed everything to git. please check that.
1,the code is written very cleanly. the only slight problem i found was the search method in houses controller is too long as it has lot of nested if statements.
1,changes were committed only at the last moment at once. please commit the changes as soon as development is complete and the code is tested.
0,checking the git log the team still committed changes in round.
0,changes to application continued throughout the second round of project submissions. many of the commits deal with the adding additional functionality to the company controller as well as additions to the i can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission.
0,i see only contributor. also only once the commit was made.
0,they committed quite many changes on the day of submission.
1,many appropriate relationships are implemented. companies to houses house to photo and house to possible buyers. i believe there should also be an association with how there reactor can only belong to one company. this will ensure many necessary functional dependencies are in place for the required application flow. keep the ones you have and continue to add missing associations as you go through the requirements check.
0,user model does include any relationship with other models.
1,not able to see the mapping between inquiries and houses. also not able to see mappings between potential buyers and houses. did you forget to commit. because the deployed version is working but does have the latest code.
0,i didn see any mapping done between tables for example the company reactor relationship in shown to n.
1,the application has really come long way from the previous submission. i believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow. there are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations users are able to assign him herself real estate company that does exist in the system. this assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping reactor to single company. this missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses. are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the reactor is associated with. this association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the reactor users can be both hunter and reactor at the same time and can switch back and forth. how do you differentiate between users abilities. probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either house hunter or reactor that would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having real estate company. inquiries are not associated with houses. this posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about. overall there have been great advances in your application since the first submit. continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold.
1,deletion of house by admin is failing. privacy breach as user i am able to see details of all other users. only admin should be able to see details of other users. overall very good effort. if the above issues were there i would have given full points.
0,new houses are not adding.
0,i could log in using the admin credentials. rest worked fine for me. could add houses in my interest list as house hunter.
1,success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module to self or with other modules. many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules. for example because houses are not properly associated with or companies reactor company appears to have no affect. administrators are not able to delete users or companies but i would image it would not throw an error. there are cases that i tested that dealt specifically around the models. example user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types. this and other edge cases of it type proved successful. it would be great to have edge case information listed in the to clarify how these cases were dealt with. again implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues.
1,not handled no actual link created between companies and users as user just stores the company name as string. instead saving the company id for the user will create relation between them as the company id will act as foreign key. that way edge case example can be handled. not handled reactor can edit delete any house that he created even if company changes. handled. when user is deleted he is automatically deleted from potential buyer list of house. the does not cover how the system handles edge cases.
0,delete of company is not working. deletion of house is not working admin should not be able to change add to his role. i was able to make admin as reactor system should not allow that
0,if as reactor i am trying to update my profile where i only change my company to random company abc it is updating just fine which i believe should not be done because the company does exist and is not even being added to the company list as new company. could check any of the admin functionality. could sign up as reactor
1,there are some really great controller tests included in this application. most of the functions in each controller are tested to ensure that they are returning and routing to the appropriate pages. unfortunately there are no model tests implemented. model tests should be written to test that the appropriate attributes and relationships of each model are implemented successfully. it will prove extremely helpful in the improved functionality of your application. make your model tests look like the controller test and you will be doing great.
0,some tests present only for houses controller.
0,only auto generated test cases present.
0,i didn find any testing done for model or controller. nor anything was mentioned in the 
0,the code looks comprehensive to good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. adding the not interested feature is plus point. the naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. no problem with respect to the coding clarity.
0,handled perfectly well.
0,the code written seems to follow nice
0,good coding practice used.
0,commented code in view controller files
0,there were commits with required changes for the second submission. commits from all team members could be seen showing their contribution.
0,yeah frequent commits were done throughout the course of project.
0, commits
1,the team has very well documented history of commits. the commit history seems to be well spaced over the entire period of the project development cycle. the team has commits in each of the submission periods and have kept on adding and updating documentation. the team could have updated their little bit more and addedd information regarding all the being assigned to individual roles and how the user experience is set up. also the team could have adde information on how to run tests in .md file
0, commits.
0,no couldnt find to relationships.
0,no form validations
0,real estate company reactor relationship should be to missing
0,the team has well structured schema. the team have defined the relationships between the tables properly. the models have defined all the relations properly.
0,company reactor relation should be but in t. also reactor house hunter should belong to user.
0,models schemas do not have the relationships defined. looks like manual table on actions which makes it difficult to maintain long term.
0,yes the team has rectified the errors from the earlier review and has implemented the needed changes. additional like the not interested feature were also used.
0,yes the problems found in first round were fixed.
0,no null checks. i can submit empty form
0, admin as an admin when creating user there is an option to create an admin can add house gives me an error im not adding picture when save can make inquiries can add houses to interest lists new hunter made did get added to the table of all user reactor when switch companies the previous houses listed from that company don appear again. hunter search does work can make inquiries or add houses for interest list
0,the authors did good job in developing the system. the system is working as it is supposed to work.
0, the web application seems to have implemented all the properly. the team have updated the repository and implemented new features after the initial submission.
0,addressed comment from st review.
0,when admin deletes company associated with reactor it gets reflected in the profile. his company name shows nothing and the houses listed were also deleted. admin is not able to view house hunters profile error in deployment but can view the same using users section. when user is deleted by admin his inquiries are removed and he is no more potential buyer too. when reactor changes creates new company his previous company houses are deleted. this is reflected in the admin table too. reactor is not able to view houses listed by others. edge cases a company can be created without filling in the fields required. yes an empty row is displayed to the hunter when company is created without any detail. but it displays the company number row number while seeing the houses. so house is shown for company that does exist in the view companies page. session control when user signs out from page and then goes back the profile page should not be shown as he is signed out. this should be considered.
0,edge cases are not handled
0,when real estate company is deleted then the house associated are also deleted. when switch companies the previous houses listed from that company don appear again. cant make inquiries
0,the following edge cases seem to have been handled and documented. on deleting user the corresponding and reactor accounts are deleted. on deleting company corresponding houses are deleted and with that company have their company set to null. on deleting or house the corresponding entry in interest list is deleted. on deleting or house corresponding inquiry is deleted
0,error o company for reactor on viewing buyers empty companies validation missing for empty info on companies admin view reactor show not working admin view hunter show not working search by area missing no fields to search by area
0,no test cases performed.
0,tested multiple controllers but don see any models being tested.
0,yes the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.
0,the team have implemented basic testing for basic crud for all the controllers and models. these look like the automatically generated tests from scaffold in rails.
0,could find spec file or any other test file.
1, the houses controller handles multiple users. it would make more sense to call methods to handle the case of each type of user. the houses controller also has several long methods. these should be broken up into method calls.
0,code follows most of the ruby good practices.
0,the team seems to have followed proper naming conventions for naming all the classes as well as all the attributes. the team seems to have written clean and readable code.
1,the code quality is well written. many of the functions are doing only one thing at time. the only limitation i could observe is lack of comments in controller as well model.
0,the team committed throughout the project and during round.
1,there are quite lot of commits meaning that the team could have grouped some of the changes together into one commit instead of every small modification to make them more meaningful
0,they have commits
0,the team has good history of commits and as can be seen from the repository the trail of commits is well documented and each new feature added or bug fixed has documented commit. the team kept pushing commits throughout both the deadlines and were regular.
0,yes total of comments and are continuously committed on the repo.
0,the database design is solid with join tables for the n relationships.
0,the rb files set the has many and belongs to relationships correctly
1,db design is kind of ok but there are redundant tables for roles hunters and users. i believe all this can be combined into one using proper fields and access control. this would have helped you guys keep the code easier as well. everything else has been handled properly.
0,the team has well designed schema and has defined all the relationships between the tables properly.
1,i can create house with no basement as reactor it also deleted my image after i unloaded it in this case before it redirected me to the new page with error information. also potential buyers are listed twice i assuming because they liked the house and submitted an inquiry to the reactor associated with it.
0,the app has the but the user display is available to all users even though that functionality has to be exclusive to the admin of the app. the reactor also has no means to add new company and there is no way to edit the user profile
1, no option to switch roles between hunter reactor no default admin reactor hunter account. maybe you forgot to run db seed on the server no validation for email while creating company. any string can be typed in. inquiries can only have reply which is field in db which gets updated
0,as reactor tried to list house with no basement but it won let me save it saying that an error is prohibiting me. it says basement is blank when clearly am selecting the no option. when changed it to yes it saved fine as an admin i can see potential buyer list for houses
0,the system is well designed and all the features have been correctly added and all the work. the authors have fixed all the problems from the previous submission.
0,the system works as it is supposed to. for example the reactor the admin and the user can login and perform the related successfully.
0,the system was very strong through edge cases and the was very detailed.
0, the reactor cannon choose company so the edge case that handle change in company is not handled
0, admin login is not working for me since i cannon use admin account cannon test edge cases related to creating deleting users or creating deleting companies search is working but is case sensitive.
0, deleted company that reactor was assigned to and it was deleted successfully but the house listed by that company is still in the house list when switched company for reactor could still deleted the house listed when was previous company when who made inquiries was deleted it got rid of their inquires from the system
0,the first edge case wherein comp any is being deleted by the admin is handled perfectly and the associated listings and inquiries are deleted accordingly. the house hunter deletion is also handled perfectly so that their inquiry are deleted accordingly. also the explains the working and the of each role properly.
0, what will happen if the admin tries to delete real estate company which has some and houses. it deletes it successfully. what will happen if reactor changes his her real estate company. will he be prohibited to remove the houses he listed in the previous company. no houses are easily changed and can be deleted by . what will happen if admin tries to delete house hunter who has submitted several inquiries. will the inquiries be automatically deleted. if this house hunter is potential buyer of house will he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list. it cannon be removed if inquiries are pending. you can come up with more edge cases. if the system fails in some edge cases explain with enough details most of the i checked such as creating house putting inquiries removing various users looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries. all works fine.
0,the tests looked good.
0,the team has tested the app using spec and thoroughly tests the user module
0,good job on testing everything with spec tests look concise and crisp.
0,the team has implemented spec testing and have thoroughly tested one model namely the users model with this. also the team has used to thoroughly test the users controller.
0,test has been written for most of the and works well. the test folder has the relevant files with well commented code.
0,all functionality seems to be there now.
0,all deletion cases are taken care of.
0,tests are good.
0,yes most of the issues identified are fixed admin not able to delete user accounts
0,controller method testing is incomplete
0,code looks very clean. i did find some commented lines of code though.
0,there were commits in total. the team pushed some commits for the round.
0,did not find such relationship in the model. did not find foreign key constraints as well.
0,the functionality is working just fine. i noticed one small problem though. as house hunter when i added house to my interest list and then click on more it says that the page that i was looking for does not exist.
0,i was able to login as admin using the credentials given in the file. still edge cases are handled well.
0,i found spec tests written for inquiry and users
1,switch role functionality could have been simplified. while logging there are two fields regarding roles. if user forgets to mark yes for reactor then switch role will be redundant. there is dependency between switch role and these fields. both do the same functionality which results in code duplication. a reactor should not be able to add inquiry he should be able to reply to inquiry.
1,all belonging to company should not be allowed to delete the company. instead only the reactor who created the company must be allowed to delete. else it can be catastrophic.
0,the team has tested parts of different models and controllers partially but none of the models controllers is thoroughly tested for complete functional verification.
0,yes by looking at their commit history the team still commit changes in round.
0,by looking at their model file they handle the relationship pretty well.
1,cannon unload the image to the house. and reactor can create an inquiry which they should not. also the reactor should able to see the potential buyer for the house under their company not only the house they create. the more button in the interest list does not work.
0, if delete company the reactor needs to find another company and the house under this company disappeared. but the does not cover the edge cases.
0,it tests the login function in the user controller but not test any models.
0,i am not sure how to create house hunter and reactor using the same email. i see link to switch roles but can only see reactor option there as it didn allow me to create an account for house hunter with same details.
0,reactor is unable to create his own company. i tried creating one it down give me an error but didn even show the company in this list.
0,no bad naming multiple calls for multiple tasks
0,submitted changes throughout the project. made commits in round.
0,handles all relationships properly
1,switch role option is working for admin too which is not supposed to be the case.
1,the team continued making commits on consistent basis throughout the project development after round. commits are named properly they describe changes that were done in the scope of that commit. one issue is that all contributors are not reflected in statistics. i would suggest matching git credentials stored on local machine to those stored on the server.
1,reactor should be associated with only one company. even though this system handles this case correctly user has field company id it also uses to relationship with companies i.e. has many companies in which is not correct.
0,need to specify role when logging in. it should identify with email. the house search feature does not seem to have been implemented. house hunter and reactor can view all inquiries of all users. sign page not complete. image not associated with house. can view potential buyers of other companies too.
0,most of the works in the application however while trying to add company as reactor after signing up the user gets the error already created company. while clicking on show on the potentials buyer list the application breaks. a house hunter is able to see all the companies which is not as per application requirement.
0,all issues related to admin functionality have been fixed. selecting company as reactor and editing it seem to be broken as such house can be posted.
0,most basic are working well. some that i found missing image unload for house has not been implemented. admin should not be able to submit inquiries to the houses or add to interest list. i could not find the link to view the inquiry replies for house hunters no link provided for house hunter to see his her interested house list potential buyers list page show button does work reactor cannon create house. even though company has been updated in the profile keep receiving message to select an existing company by editing profile.
0,some of link when clicked on back redirect the users somewhere not intended.
1,there are some glitches. if you go on to look for potential buyers from any house listing from admin section the code breaks. example try this from the after opening any house from admin section. it fails
0, reactor is unable to add house even after setting his her company. for that reason i cannon verify that reactor is able to edit delete his her added company. i could not find the view where reactor would see replies for inquiries. i could not verify switching functionality. the indicates that this link or option is only available for the users who have signed up both as and house hunters. however i could not sign up with two roles because the radio button used in the form only allows for one option.
0,throws error when deleting house hunter who has an inquiry.
0,the is very helpful in guiding through the application. most of the cases have not been handled by the application. there is no functionality to unload picture to the houses. a new house hunter is able to see all the inquires made by all the house hunters which is not as per the application design.
0,when house is deleted the inquires and replies are deleted as well this has been handled. error page occurs when i try to sign up for the same role with the same email. error in deleting user if the user has submitted an inquiry reply house hunter can add house to interest list multiple times should not be allowed by maybe hiding the button if the house is already in the current user interest list. does not cover how the system handles edge cases.
0, reactor cannon add house so could not be tested. admin is unable to delete house hunter who has submitted inquiries but no proper explanation or error message is displayed. system handles house deletion properly. all relevant inquiries are deleted.
0,after signing up as reactor i edited the profile and selected company. however i can post house the system kept asking me to update my profile and select one of the companies. alert create new company or select an existing company by editing profile to post house. when the admin deleted the company the house that belongs to the company were not destroy. guarded chamber this crashes
0,the team has not written any test cases for the entities. there are only the default test cases.
0,yes they have tested controller but not the model.
0,the model test just tested the email attribute of the real estate company and the controller test mainly tested for successful responses and redirect and not page content and method calls.
0,this team claimed to have fully tested the model and controller but there were no tests in the tests. i didn check every file after since i don like being lied to
0,last moment commits.
0,the testing was done
0,the system has been fully deployed and tests for the models and controllers are performed for the users involved in the system. the team checked for the edge case wherein the admin deleted the real estate company.
1,some methods were long and there was lot of commented out code. there was at least one instance of bad indentation. otherwise the methods were overall fairly short and the naming was sensible.
1,the code quality in this application looks good. i didn see any extremely large methods views were clean and simple and controllers had one to one mappings with application level functions. i do think i would encourage this team to consider using scopes in their models next time as i did not see many here.
0,the code is clear and simple most functions have seperate method calls.
0,the code followed the basic practices for clean and effective programming using ruby and rails. the methods and function calls were efficient in that they only performed the task it was assigned to do.
0,they started adding more commits after the first round of reviews.
0,the team kept committing their changes even in round.
1,a major portion of the project was completed in the first stage itself. certain noticeable changes that the team implemented in this stage included setting up admin to view and destroy the reactor or accounts.
0,the models had the correct relationships. the database seemed to have missed some of these. there was not table for potential buyers to house hunter relationship.
0,i think this team nailed the entity relationships with this application. everything had the right relationships.
0,the relationships between various entities is clear.
0,the relationships of reactor to real estate company or reactor to house hunter justified proper mapping between them. the system handled the to and to relationships properly.
1,overall this was usable system. however this app did not do good job of keeping track of my session. once i edited that admin account i could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign in again if i clicked admin sign in. even if i signed up as different user my admin account was still signed into. i also was not logged in upon signing up as reactor or house hunter. some other comments are an admin should be able to set the password for reactor or house hunter. that is security vulnerability. when i tried to use the reset password link i get an error. when creating house as an admin i should have to know the id of the company i should be provided drop down of existing companies the same way for how reactor chooses company to join. asking reactor to choose or create company before signing up is another security vulnerability you leak the existing companies and allow someone who in a user of your system to create company. the inquiry and interest flow in this application is really well done.
0,as house hunter i could edit houses. also anyone can create company and reactor cannon create company before signing up. a reactor could not submit reply to an inquiry. a reactor could not drop his or her company and could list house without choosing company. last table ids are all over the site which is confusing and not helpful to the user. these ids should not appear to the user or have to be used to create new entities.
0,the search button in not there. no way to add new house. reactor is given some destroy privileges which are not meant for him.
0,the basic in the system are working properly
0,the user interface of the system helps to understand the general flow of the program. it also supports sessions and enables user to navigate based on their tasks.
0, the admin encountered an exception when trying to view potential buyers of house after its only potential buyer was deleted. the did not describe how the system handles edge cases.
0,here few things i found i could list house that was built in the future. i was also required to give full date instead of just year. i was able to edit house as house hunter
0,the file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled. when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and under it were also deleted. however the role switch option between reactor and is not available further this operation cannon be performed manually also as the code mail id from being used for two accounts.
0,upon testing the system for edge cases the following results were obtained. the real estate company is destroyed and the houses and houses inquiries for the same are removed. the reactor can switch to another company. they will be prohibited to remove the houses listed in the previous company though. the house hunter accounts are deleted without their inquiries. the system does not check for fr phone number input during sign
0,code in the model methods looks very clean. attribute symbols are appropriately validated and proper constraints are applied to measure uniqueness. the controller code has great parenthesis and bracket use for function calls and assignments. more consistent spacing of functions and function content would aid in the readability of the code. also there are few instances where conditional blocks are empty. if there is no purpose for the block it should be removed example found in the static page controller. overall the code seems to implement good ruby style standards.
0,the code is readable and easy to understand but at the same time it is not effectively are several methods which perform the functions of other methods too which could have better been modularised apart from that
0,most of the code is auto generated from rails generator so they do the generic thing. although they have connected most of the app the basic are still lacking and no new code has been written. the only part i see is the sessions controller that has been written manually and follows correct coding convention.
0,yes that is taken care of. no bad naming. questionable redirection.
0,the repository name in what it is supposed to be. naming seems inappropriate. plus there is no read me file explaining the flow of 
0,code quality looks good. standard conventions have been used. it is also good to see that the team has used for data generation.
0,some direction code is ambiguous
1,there are no issues with code quality or naming. code is clean and readable and follows ruby on rails practices. most methods are short and do one specific task. one possible improvement would be moving out authorization functionality from controller methods to separate functions.
0,group continued to revise and commit changes for the project throughout round two. commits were clearly stated as to the purpose. you can see the development process of the project through the changes applied.
0,the commits were not scattered throughout the development cycle rather they were concentrated on particular couple of days which indicate that the project was last minute rush rather than pre planned and well executed one.
0,very few commits in the project with most commits coming just from one user towards the deadline period. a lot of commits done after the deadline period
0,the team did not commit their changes throughout the project period. the changes were committed in round.
0,yes commits in total and they have consistently kept on working on git throughout.
0,no majority are near deadlines and not well spread out. usage of multiple branch is good.
0,the team has pushed almost all the commits on days of the entire cycle not regular. also the commits are made by one person which seems strange to me.
1,most commits were done by one person which cannon be considered good practice. naming of commits is done well names are descriptive of the introduced changes. i would suggest doing commits more often by dividing work into smaller chunks.
0,it seems that some of the associations were attempted. real estate company contains many users and houses and house belongs to real estate company and user. these relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced. there are additional connections missing such as the users model where reactor should belong to only single company and many houses. the implementation seems incomplete but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction.
0,the relationship mapping was appropriate and worked as intended. the database unfortunately didn implement all the necessary features required for the submission. for example list of potential buyers
0,all the n relationships have been commented out. there are no mapping table in schema as well.
0,to the most extent of it. since the profile of admin is problematic and not allowing us to login at all. that area is unavailable for testing.
0,as of now all relationships have been commented out i am not sure why this has been done.
1,following are some of the relationships missing house hunter has many inquiries reactor has one company
0, to and to relationships are handled correctly. the system utilizes foreign key columns in the database to achieve this. for example to relationship between reactor and real estate company is achieved by adding company id field to user table. same utilized by houses table which are linked to one reactor and one company.
0,can not log in as admin
1,your home page is very clear as to the application purpose. unfortunately i am unable to sign up as new user or login with any of the pre configured user accounts included in the i can however attempt to sign up and or login but this information is never saved to the database for future access or the appropriate is not implemented. i like that there are two options listed on the homage to either sign up as new user or to login in as current user. this is convenient for navigation. consider spacing these links for easier identification. i would also point out that the options in the drop down box included for selecting user type during sign up is great idea. the third option is ambiguous as to its purpose. what does it mean to sign up as reactor who is also shopping for house. perhaps you can just limit the options to reactor or house hunter. the functionality of searching homes should be included in the reactor services. keep up the work. once the database is successfully receiving user details and or the appropriate routes are assigned additional should be easy to implement.
0,there are lot of functional bugs. also lots of required like listing house as interested list of potential buyers etc are missing. also there are lot of navigational bugs. for example when user is both reactor and he gets an option to create new company when viewing list of enquiries which should not have been the cae.
0, admin login is not working for me cannon login through default reactor hunter accounts no search functionality for houses no image unload for houses views are bit messed up it shows inquire about house in create company page. navigation is not proper creating new house redirect you to the home page inquiries feature although implemented does not work no reply feature
0,the author improved the application but still did not fix all the problems. for an instance the inquiry option is created but it does not work properly. after creating an inquiry the user gets logged out immediately. also the created inquiry is not visible under my inquiries options. the interest in particular house option is still not given.
0,admin functionality is failing. not able to log in as it should.
0,the system now works as expected. the common are working
0,multiple roles seems to be missing. eg. for the details for house hunter given in get logged into reactor profile same is when i create new user and log in create company get message that user has been created welcome to the real estate manager hunter user was successfully created.
0,most of the are added and seem to be working. there are some breakages like reactor has create inquiries option which should not be present and it breaks on clicking it. search based on footage price location have not been added. interest list for the user and potential buyers list for the reactor is not added.
0,when summit an inquiry the page automatically redirect to the homage and can not find the user page.
0,i am unable to log in as admin with credentials that are provided in search houses functionality for house hunter is missing. inquiries are not added to the system and page that is supposed to display all the inquiries is not working.
0, unable to login as admin. reactor can delete houses but houses don seem to map to real estate company rather they are mapped to the reactor only unable to login as admin
0,i am unable to test any edge cases as logging into the system as any type of user is not implemented.
0, since admin login is not working this cannon be tested reactor can still edit the house after changing his company inquiries feature although implemented is not working since the basic are still lacking i believe the edge cases have not been handled anywhere.
0,i could not login as an admin using the user password combination mentioned in 
0,fails this edge case due to unavailable admin functions. this function fails to. not available. reactor inquiries are also non functional.
0,since there is no file admin access is not clear or how to navigate to those features. so most of the cases could not be checked due to ambiguity in the flow.
0,most functionality is either broken or not present. delete real estate company not present. create house not present. on user create get welcome to the real estate manager user user was successfully created. send inquiry logs out the user
0,cannon test as delete functionality is missing. cannon test as functionality is missing. cannon test as delete functionality is missing.
0,most of the edge cases cannon be tested due to problems with accessing admin account. functionality pertaining to inquiries add edit delete is not implemented.
1,there is only single test file included with this application sessions controller test. the functionality tested within this file attempts to cover starting new user session. the test ensures that new session is returned through an assertion statement equating to true. there are many additional functions of the sessions controller that should be tested including create destroy successful log in etc. making sure that each of these methods are functional will aid in the development of further successful application flows. i would recommend testing the basic models and their accompanying controllers before you begin implementing things such as house inquires and user responses.
0,the application seems to have been developed but not tested enough as apart from just navigational bugs there are also functional bugs. many of the required things are also not implemented hence there was not much stuff to rate for.
0,no tests have been written. at least under the tests folder.
0,no tests performed seem visible as exceptional flow is uneven.
0,no they have not. no models were tested.
0,no tests added for model or controller
0,testing has not been performed appropriately. handling only one case called testing
0,no tests for either model or controller are present.
0,there are no test cases other than those auto generated by the scaffold generator thus cannon comment more on testing.
1,the code has been implemented in modular way. however there are few functions where ruby naming conventions has not been followed for example in class.
1,code is well written. functions are well defined. some areas where it can be improved is moving the house search logic from controllers to the respective models.
0,clean code and readable. yes. no. none
1,the code is clean and readable but there only one suggestion. the page which lists houses index and search houses are handled by different controllers whereas they could have been easily integrated into one without compromising code readability. it would have lead to more integrated and cohesive web app. in one or two instances there were several functions performed within function which could have been better modularised too.
0,very well written in the style of writing and the ruby mac architecture is properly implemented. they have suitably defined methods to handle particular tasks following the appropriate mac architecture and also following the correct session management. nothing is inappropriately named. they have very smartly worked on it. coding style is absolutely conversant with the ruby on rails flavor of coding.
0,the code is very well written.
0,code is clean and well written. a task is handled by only one method. there are no bad naming in this project and is neatly organised with instructions. no issues with the code.
0, the code is written in clean and readable way.
0,yes the team has been making commits through out the project tenure as well as round.
0,the commits are visible through out. yes commits have occurred in round.
0,they have worked on the project lot commits each one being descriptive. good job there.
0,yes they did. commits
0,yes the changes were mostly evenly spread out throughout the development cycle. this shows consistent efforts throughout.
0,yes they have total of commits which shows the consistency shown by them in working through the project and updating the changes. they have made lot of vital changes in round.
0,yes there are commits continuously made to the code as latest as hours ago during review.
0,yes the team kept on submitting their changes throughout their project. there are total of commits from the team and they still committed changes in round. they have committed the changes with proper messages also.
0, they continued to update their project. however some changes were made after the due date.
0,yes the system handles all the entity relationships well. there is no mapping table as such but all relationships has been addressed in correct association degree in the application.
0,relationships have not been defined in the models.
0,inquiry mapping is not done.
0,inquiry does belong to either house or user
0,the relationships in the db table have been carefully defined and they have taken care to relate to for houses house hunters inquiries and so on.
0, by looking at their model file they handled the relationship properly.
1,the system has all the basic as per the program description. as per the last feedback validation checks for invalid data has been added to the application. however the system still does not have the null checks for field. for example if user creates house without adding most of the details the application breaks. houses
0, can sign up without specifying company. this means if there are no companies in the system can sign up. while creating new company address field is given as drop down with only two options raleigh and cary. can specify any other address. also in the create company page size of the company is again given as drop down with limited options. can give any other value. admin can create new houses.
0,except inquiry reply all other work in my opinion.
0,multiple success message still not fixed
1,the system works well in most of the cases except when the reactor creates his company and then after successfully creating the company he get an option to edit his company details but then when he clicks the edit button it redirect to the homage and is unable to edit his company info unless he choses to belong to the particular company. a minor bug but still breaks the consistency.
0,perfectly functional and very well styled with the use of cos and also the gui is very user friendly.
1,the system works exactly how it is supposed to work. i could not find any that are still failing. no bugs or error messages. it would have been better if the reactor could send replies to inquiries directly from the application than opening separate mail application.
0,search is not working. anyone can login as admin. no house picture is displayed if it is saved.
0, admin should not able to submit an inquiry and put house in interest list. also the user should not able to sign up as an admin. and reply to the inquiry function must use the email system to reply cannon do it onsite. when creating company the user can only choose raleigh and cary as their address. cannon see the house list by other company.
0,the edge case when admin deleted the real estate company has been handled as after the admin deletes the real estate company the houses listed under that company are all deleted. the reactor when changes the company cannon see the house listed under previous company so he would not be able to delete the houses under previous company. no the does not contain any details on the edges cases handling.
0,deleting company does delete its houses.
0,when real estate company is deleted the respective houses are deleted the are not. further even after deletion the company of those remains the same. they can even edit the deleted company from their profile and list house on behalf of the deleted company. when reactor edits and updates his company after it is deleted it actually gets created again. when reactor changes his company he can view only the houses of his current company and is prohibited to delete houses of his previous company. this works as expected. when house hunter is deleted he gets removed from the potential buyers list but inquiries are only partially deleted as in the row is still there but only two columns show data.
0, when an admin deletes company which has existing it shows on the admin page that the company is deleted but when the reactor signs in it still shows that he belongs to the deleted company and is able to update all the profile information of the company. so it means the company is not being deleted even when it says so on the admin page. the reactor in able to view any houses except his own company. no the inquiries are not auto deleted nor is the removed from potential buyers list.
0,this test case is flaw as an admin can hitherto delete whenever and whatever he wants. this too is not strongly tested and runs into glitches on doing so. this too falls through when tested. the admin can be deleted and edited with. system fails overall when this case happens. biggest flaw yet unresolved.
0,edge cases are not explicitly handled but the validations and logic will limit edge case scenarios from affecting the application.
0, if the admin deletes company all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any reactor if the reactor changed his or her company the reactor cannon make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. so they will not be able to edit add or remove the houses listed in previous company. if the house hunter is deleted by the admin all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. the did not cover how the system handles all these edge cases. could be updated.
0,if company is delete the house will also disappear and the reactor need to find new company. but the does not cover edge cases.
0,the team has not created any test cases to test the model and controllers of multiple entities.
0,no test cases could be found.
1,yes the login sign module seems to be very well tested considering the fact that all the three types of users and are managed by using the same table. but there also small functional bug. even if i had registered as or reactor i am able to switch back and forth between the roles which is kind of counter intuitive in many ways.
0,there seems to be rudimentary test they have implemented as gathered by going through their file application system test. this and the test file in the models shows that they have taken sufficient efforts to thoroughly examine their code.
0,none of the controller or model are tested.
0, they test the controller but not the model.
0,when reactor changes real estate companies they are able to edit houses listed from the new real estate company but not from their old one. when user with inquiries gets deleted so do the inquiries.
0,the code is clean and readable. the file is not updated hence it is not reviewer friendly. most methods are short and do specific task. none. questionable redirection
1,i saw lot of places were instance variables were used when the didn need to be ie using var instead of just var in methods. i think naming seemed appropriate were i looked. this team made good use of helper functions and classes though there were some rather large functions in those classes. i saw lot of complicated views which to indicates lack of separation of concerns. i would recommend being more diligent about the scope of variables and continue trying to push concerns responsibilities to isolated classes and methods.
1,the logic in the code looks proper still the code itself is hard to follow. primarily because lot of functionality has been added in method whose name suggests only partial functionality and no comments have added anywhere. examples are in controller the methods get reactor nav bar and get nav bar make sql queries and other in houses controller the show method also has lot code that ideally should not belong in that method. i would suggest to put such code in different methods or name the method better. do not shy away from creating different methods if need be it organises code much better and simpler to understand.
0, readable code separation of tasks
0,no deployment link
0,good coding standard
0,the code is pretty clean.
0,the team has committed changes during round though the changes haven been spaced evenly. most of them are close to the deadline. also the changes haven even spaced evenly. the names of the commits were descriptive.
0,yes this team did lot of work after the initial set of reviews.
1,yes the team made commits regularly but some commits whose name suggest changes to the code not hero deployment were done after the deadline of th oct. if those changes were later reversed or not cannon be ensured. from the reviewer perspective i would suggest not to add any changes at all after the deadline as we should be bothered about looking at what change is done in each commit. stick to the work you had as it would be graded appropriately by the instructors.
0, yes timely commits on 
0,yes the team kept committing changes in round.
0,lot of commits and branches
1,most of them are correct. in inquiry the mapping is wrong in my opinion. it says has many users has many houses inquiry belongs to one house and one user who creates the inquiry.
1,i think this team did not correctly implement several database relationships. for instance house does not have many users it has single reactor the reactor who posted it and it might have many interested users potential buyers but that should have been via through relationship. another example is inquiries. an inquiry has one user for one house not many users and many houses.
1,in my opinion inquiries should belong to user. one inquiry belongs to user and one user has many inquiries.
0, all relationships are mentioned in the model
0,most of the relations holds good
0,certain basic related to roles and switching roles are working. the reactor was being able to create new company and new inquiry which as far as i know is not in the reactor functionality. the inquiry listing for reactor link fails on click on show of any inquiry.
0,i still was not provided link to deployed application. i re read the as carefully as i could but could not find one.
0, after signing up as reactor show inquiries is not working a reactor cannon thus reply to an inquiry after signing up as hunter a hunter is able to create company which should be not allowed an inquiry should be created for particular house which is not the case new inquiry is not working shows success false message
0,admin account credentials not listed
0,seems there is something wrong with the interest list. i added house in user interest list but it appears in user list for some reason. everybody can see the previous user information.
1,could not login as administrator no information for login provided in or the doc. changing house hunter role to reactor did not list related to reactor hence the reactor was not able to check join companies. please check with review password password. could not login as administrator no information for login provided in or the doc. i had just created house hunter account but i could see my interested houses and inquiries. this does seem to be correct. interest list to user mapping is not done correctly. the file does not provide details regarding the application. hence it is not easy to review the application. while updating the user the password field is visible. this is major security concern.
0,same comment as above. i could not test this application.
0, user is able to sign up as admin which should not happen admin is able to delete real estate companies admin is not able to view inquiries
0,not able to log in as admin no credentials given in 
0, does not cover edge cases.
0,user level seem to do be correctly. also i could not create an account with the same email id again.
0,model has not been tested.
0,no testing have been done
1,the code looks good but it has slightly long methods. the naming used also appears appropriate.
0,since i could view the test plan am unable to comment on it.
0,the test plan seems to be missing
0,i could not find any test plan or documentation and hence could not verify whether the tests have passed or no. tests for checking for duplicate directories due to assignments having same names is missing.
0,as mentioned earlier they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence we are assuming that they are to implement testing at further point in the project. of course mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped. moreover the absence of doc only adds to the grievances of being unable to decipher the problem statements.
0,they don have test plan.
0,unfortunately the team has not provided any link to the write up. hence i would not be able to provide reviews for this question.
0,no tests added or at least link in provided
1,could not see the test plan as write up link has not been provided. looking at the code also it seems as if no tests are written. it is always good practice to follow add please write test cases to test the changes made.
1,the names are all proper. however there are lines of code which are commented out. cleaning up that would reduce the clutter.
0,the links provided are only of commits and not the code added.
1,names could have been better designed especially the variable. i get no idea about what that variable is used for or what that implements. you can rename it to question or duplicate directory etc.
1,on checking the code we find that in agreement with the code had build error which seems to be unresolved which is strange and should have been looked into. moreover the overall coverage shows good amount of increase which is good. but one must say that the details in the code changes as few as they seem have been to good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit.
1,good work. need to work on tests.
0,there are no new variables etc. the code looks fine and logical.
1,the team has only made one significant change to the following file app controllers assignments controller it is an if statement which is difficult to follow since the team has not written any comments for the same. suggestion the team could add comments and screenshots for better understand of the workflow in the second submission
0,extremely small change. no bad naming in question.
1,i can guess the array means question paraeters but this variable name is confusing i think they should use question param instead.
1,issue below is the change made in directory name will be if not provided. in the form of assignment name id course id. the last part could be modified to something with bit more clarity. from the assignments controller code it could be seen that the auto generated directory name follows the format assignment name assignment id course id which is not what is specified in the text. there is typo in the word it needs to be hyphenated as auto generated.
0,there are much big changes. the changes have been crisp and self explanatory.
1,more comments are needed because i had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. the code follows ruby style guide and is dry in its design. functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. kudos.
0,functions are of appropriate length and well structured with respect to the purpose in question. all code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them. no the comments have been well placed and self explanatory making it easy to follow. the code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard. nope all code is consistent and to the point.
1,i feel you guys should add few comments for third person to follow.
0,the added code is crisp and of required size. there in much addition anyway to worry about it violating dry principles.
0,the team has only made one significant change to the following file app controllers assignments controller it is an if statement which is difficult to follow since the team has not written any comments for the same.
0,extremely small change. no problems found.
1,issue in the assignments controller code the team has checked in puts statement line which looks like debut code. even though these are helpful during the development phase we need to remove them before finally pushing them. issue the comment assignments controller is not descriptive enough. the author has commented out method call. it would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this. please provide detailed comment on why this was done. again the author has use puts statement submitted which should not be committed and should only be used during development debutging. please remove the debug code.
0,since the test plan is not included am unable to do the manual testing.
1,manual testing seems an impossible task since it is not having doc itself which makes it impossible to have specific design flow for the project in question to go ahead and check the program.
1,the features work as intended however i am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. could have made demo video showing the improvements or step guide to follow. they could have also provided some steps or visual navigation guide to see the changes. for edge cases you could check what happens when assignments have same names blank or containing names etc.
0,the team has not provided any link for me to manually test the project
0,they didn provide link for me to test their work.
0,no video or deployment link provided to test manually.
0,the link for the is missing.
0,the seems to be missing.
0,no clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. only file names are stated along with changes made. why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given. no write up link has been provided. it was tough to navigate the code myself. no demo or link provided as well.
0,no the team has not been diligent in specially making section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. they have seemed to not even make page for the same or have seemed to forget to unload it. because how am i supposed to follow the approach and solution of the problem if there does exist any documentation to check for the same.
0,there is no write up provided as of now. the page is also not done yet.
0,didn find any documentation link. but it was understandable from the code links on goal is to create unique directories for each assignment.
0,no link provided.
0,they don have page link so i cann see their oss 
0,the link to the is missing.
1,testing is absent in the project. this could have been because by the looks of it the issues were too small only lines code. refer spec documentation to write tests. it is easy to follow.
1,unfortunately no mention of the word test plan has even taken place in their whole doc. so it seems that they are yet to implement the testing in their project. although it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository. moreover as part of their project one of their problem statements is in fact to write the tests for specific problem scenario. i have reason to believe even that has not been done judging from the pull request.
0,issues were fixed but dont see any tests as mentioned in issue.
0,there are no tests. probably you guys will do it in the next phase.
0,the seems to be missing.
1,no mention is made as to why the changes were made in which specific files. the code is well written but hard to follow what is the functionality of the code is tough to decipher. it would have been better had there been some comments or documentation as to what those respective methods do.
0,no since no write up or no page exists. it is clearly not possible to ascertain any of the above clauses.
1,write up in provided. i went through their git commit and the requirement for issue. there is puts statement in the controller. i feel that should be removed you guys might have added it for debugging purposes but it should be removed before committing. also not sure how the changes made are applicable to the problem at hand which is to check if assignments have the same name if i not wrong.
0,no documentation found.
0,i cannon find test plan.
0,no they did write the test plan.
0,all tests pass all descriptions in the test plan are just the test cases in the spec file yeah i guess they all exist.
0,authors have followed ruby style guide. test cases have not been discussed in the write up.
0,no test plan was included. the bare minimum of description was given for each test and the project preamble. as far as i can tell though there is no document that says we should have created test plan and i bet it is safe to say that their mentor did not suggest creating test plan either.
0,the is lacking in terms of explanation of how to test the functionality thoroughly.
0,their variables methods and class names are good
0,spec tests look just fine and descriptions are intuitive.
0,variable names and test cases are named appropriately. explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.
0,it looks like if they fix some style issues then it could increase the code coverage. i don understand why their last unit test does not pass though.
0,some of the functions are too long such as delete function.
0,the tests look fine. it easy to follow what the tests do.
0,some let methods like participant student response map are repetitive.
0,all of the code appears to be above board and no functions are overly long. the test did take like seconds to run which seems like lot.
0,the work takes care of all the edge cases accurately.
0,yes their code works and some edge cases are also correct.
0,the video shows all the test cases pass but i skeptical that they got all the corner cases. looking at the review response mark model there are lot of methods which are explicitly tested.
1,code is running and no errors are encountered. however very few tests have been written and coverage is low. a way to make the testing more robust is to test every function with known success case and an edge case or potential failure.
0,source code is good in all spots except the last unit test. i was unable to figure out why it did not work.
1,some branches are skipped by the allow statement. if method would raise an exception then test whether it would raise it.
0,the clearly explains the problem statement
0,the page has showed up what the is and some examples have show up what the task of the team is.
0,they don not have any test plan and some functionality of code is not adequate for the test.
0,there basically no documentation outside the source code itself.
0,i could understand what the project does. however there are fewer examples of the test.
0,this is semi passable. the is hosted on pedia so they clearly didn read the directions. i mean i get it though. i wrote tests and was also unclear about what exactly the should contain.
0,i can not find the test plan.
0,they don not have test plan.
0,it unclear how complete the test plan is because their does not contain their total branch or mutation coverage.
0,no this does have test plan section.
1,as this rubric calls for section called test plan i suggest adding it and rearranging the content so that description of the tests is given in this section
0,this is not fair ask. as far as i can tell there is no document that says we should create test plan.
0,the approach taken by the team to increase the code coverage has not been clearly stated. also there is no mention about what was the existing code coverage and how much did the team increase it to.
0,test plan is missing
0,the test plan is not added as the part of 
0,the team does not show up any design in the page the authors did not explain how and why they did and what i can see is just the final code for some particular 
0,yes they have explained the way and why they did and in their they does not mention any principles or patterns.
0,there not really rationale for why these particular tests are sufficient.
1,the authors have included the different tests that they wrote however description of what the test is testing would be helpful.
0, they wrote the literal least possible but again i get it. learning how to test with doubles mocks stubs and spies to peek in on the innards of high complexity oo system was actually really difficult.
0,no details about what was changed only details related to already existing implementation has been stated.
0,several methods are missing in the document and the spec file like review response report import.
0,only one test case implemented and executed which verifies whether the correct email has been sent to the reviewer.
0,all test cases are currently passing
0, test plan is not described fully. however whatever is mentioned in the doc has been implemented via spec but there are some previously running tests which are failing because of the changes.
0,an old test case fails. looks like it was broken before and therefore not result of your changes
0,all the cases discussed in test plan have been converted into automated tests.
0,most of the cases are covered in should send an email to the participant test case. reviewer part and its mail content checks are not covered.
0,yes unit tests spec are provided.
1,i did not find the test plan in the documentation. however there were details mentioned about the tests that the team wrote. one test related to the issue has been written in the assignment participant spec file. the test works works properly. i feel that the test plan should have been explicitly mentioned in the documentation.
0,action mirror successfully implemented. active record is also getting updated properly.
1,there are some repetitions in the code which can be avoided by creating helper function and calling that function from each place. but apart from that code is well thought out and implemented nicely.
0,there were some issues initially when looked at the code. but the professor has already made those suggestions about naming conventions and following the design pattern and to write appropriate methods in the right models or controllers. looks good now.
0, no naming issues found
0,the method names variable names and class names are intuitive and suggestive of the functionality.
0,code looks perfect. follows standards.
0,the naming conventions have been followed. the professor had frequently asked the team to improve the naming conventions and it seems that the conventions have been properly 
1,all ruby looping constructs followed to good extent. the code could be possible
0,follows most he good coding practices. follows dry follows ruby style guide and has no error in code climate as well
1,looks good. comments could be improved. for example in submitted content controller there is comment which says sending email to users. however it is just method call which redirect it to delayed mailer so this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone or understanding the code later.
1,the code changes in app controllers submitted content controller line could have been in separate method such as send email to reviewers. that would make the controller code clean and clear. code changes does not follow the dry principle in two places. in app mailers delayed mailer there is no need to duplicate the code. the code in the new method review reminder email has been copied from email reminder. the email reminder method can be used instead of creating separate method altogether. app models assignment and app models course uses same code to send the via mail to user that can be put in one place so that it can be reused in both the places.
1,the code follows dry principle. none of the functions is very long. more comments could be added but not required.
0,code is not dry.
1,i feel that the code from line to could have been written in separate function to avoid making the function submit hyperfine from becoming so large. additionally the functionality inside the function review reminder email could have been separated into different functions.
0,clear statement and well layout of the page.
0,all the features are implemented according to the documentation submitted.
0,edges cases are covered well in the tests
1, the features work. however the notice messages could be improved to state exactly the action that is conducted. eg. one of the notice message says either user is already added or it does exist. narrowing it down will be of great value.
0,the features work as intended.
0,fix is working good. link is up.
0,the test has already covered edge cases.
0,clearly mentions implementation details an the problem descriptions
0,documentation is concise and clear
1,the document clearly explains what work is done. one section for each issue. the deadline reminder functionality explains what code is changed but overall what the use case is and what task needs to be performed could have been explained better.
0,very well written well explained with all the nitty gritty implementation details.
0,the is written very clearly gives good idea about the project.
0,very detailed. all the implementation details are clearly explained.
1,the is thorough but screenshots could be added. the instructions are missing too. rest all looks good.
0,the is written really well. the description about the functionality has been mentioned clearly. good job.
0,the is clear.
0,very clearly. the authors provide sufficient information about improve the email function such as when become participant.
0,only one test is implemented and validated for.
0,test plan is well thought out and thorough.
1,the authors have mentioned the test they have performed but no specific plan is presented. however they have adequate details about what is done and what is tested and how will the corresponding changes look like. edge case descriptions could have been included
0,the test case does not handle the case when the imported is corrupted.
0,the test plan section is missing in the but they have included separate section for explaining spec based automated test cases.
0,yes conditions are tested well.
1,the details regarding testing are mentioned in the but i did not find anything about the test plan as such in the the assignment participant spec contains test. one edge case has been considered. i feel that the test plan should have been mentioned in the explicitly.
1,maybe add the code to 
0,they do have clear testing section but not said as test plan.
0,the report mentions all the required details like the problem statement the old version of the code and the improved version of the code and how well it is improved and implemented thus the report is also very well articulated
0,yes each topic description starts with what the current issue is what are the changes made and how is it impacted and what is the end result. nicely articulated
1,code changes does not follow the dry principle in two places. also the comments in the code are not helpful. all code comments are like e fall which does not explain what is the code does it only says when the code was added. such comments may be removed.
0,the implementation strategy is clearly discussed in the which is easy to follow.
0,yes the bug to fix flow is very well explained. comprehensive and easy to understand.
1,yes the explains the problem statement the solution implemented. but snippets of code not added and screenshots missing too. too many links. could just add some snippets to make it more readable.
0,the explains the implementation approach for every functionality that they implemented.
0,yes all the have done are shown in the link.
0,test plan been defined because the testing is carried out by 
0,could not find any
0,the pull request does not show any tests done on the project
0,i don see any test plans.
0,the newly added code has not yet been accepted in the pull request but it does build. the corresponding rust implementation however has not been added and so the test coverage improved by much.
0,seems all variables and methods follow certain naming rules.
1,the newly added code includes the attribute height the and method in the file. the name height given for the attribute height for the canvas makes complete sense. similarly the name given for the method that returns the is also intuitive. the name is little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often. instead the accessory convention of using feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time.
0,the build did not pass due to some minor inconsistencies.
0,the variable method and class names all seem to be reasonable and well written.
0,there are almost no comments.
0,all codes construct perfectly though not much code i could see in the git.
0,the team has not implemented any function in the pull request. they have basically defined the interface that will be implemented in the future by servo. there can be few comments to describe their code and about the previous implementation.
0,the code seems dry and follows good design principles avoiding redundancy.
0,the code is really well written and follows ruby style guide except some areas.
0,the implementation does not seem to be working so it would be difficult to test this. also i am no rust programmer so there that.
0,the features cannon be tested until the final changes are completed
0,can not run servo as i dont have the needed environment.
0,i have no idea how to test the code manually.
0,the code is running. however few are not there.
1,the background sections were fairly clear but the details could have been fleshed out more. some description of the code would be better than dump of the code.
1,yes the is clear and explains most aspects of the project but there could be better explanation for the ill files that were added and the corresponding changes that were made because of adding these files
0,the lists lot of terminology but few with how they do this project.
0,a little too brief.
1,the write up gave good introduction to the project by providing the background information about the servo parallel web engine project by for web page rendering and rust programming language to execute and cos parsers. it then highlighted the api that can be used to generate frames and also return the rendered image using the method. the covered how web workers can be used to implement api to render images as an independent process isolated from the seepage the problem statement of of creating and renderingcontext interfaces with constructor properties width and height and method was defined. the use of web ill to describe interfaces for web browsers was briefed and that was followed by the code flow and the code snippet of the two web ill files namely .webidl and renderingcontext while the write up was cogent and clearly explained the work done it could have elaborated on the implementation of the methods like and how the interface is integrated into the system to render images in seepage using an isolated web worker.
0,the was well written and explained what the project was about. it also mentioned the purpose of the project along with the technology used to implement the same.
0,the document is really well written specifying clearly the worked on.
0,there is no test plan section or any information on how or if the feature was tested.
0,no test plan.
0,test plan missing.
0,no test plan was provided
0,the write up does not include test plan section. if test section had been included then the different scenarios pre conditions edge cases and invalid input values would have been dealt.
0,the project didn involve any kind of testing.
0,the does not include any test plan.
0,the clearly explained the need for the off screen canvas api however the explanation of how the feature was implemented was too shallow. what is in those files.
1,the includes the code used but it would help if the also explained how the authors came up with that solution
0,not any clue.
0,it is not explained why the work was done the way it is done. but the implementation looks promising
1,the write up did cover about the efficiency of servo to render quickly and smoothly when compared to other rendering engines. servo does this using parallel layout styling web renders and constellation and in turn the processes threads and tasks that allows the browser to fail better hence making it more robust and secure. it justified the use of rust to rewrite c and effectively the browser as well.
0,the details the work done by the authors and mentions how they approached implementing the api.
0,the explains what is intended to be done. however still the information is somewhat incomplete.
0,all the cases discussed in the test plan have been implemented. well done in achieving test coverage and passing all the tests.
0,over. i mean. great job testing participant all.
0,yes.
0,yes and it all passes too.
1,they haven added any test plan but the test method in documentation shows that all test cases has been checked properly and coverage is also.
0,every test case that is provided on the page is part of the automated test suite. there are no cases of failing tests.
0,yes they have automated test and all of them pass
0,names for variables classes and method are properly named and make sense.
0,the pull both and travis suggest there are few issues with style and integration that need to be addressed respectively.
0,they kept working on it and did really impressive.
0,didn find any pull request. code coverage has increased as more tests are written and it is one of the required outcomes. states that coverage is achieved and the same is demonstrated in the video link provided.
0,it looks great. everything is followed.
0,can find the pull request
1,most of the source code is following standard ruby practices. however some cases could be improved. there is number of variable names that are with numbers for example user user etc. while this approach can be justified in some cases i would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. moreover indentation needs to be fixed to improve code readability.
0,yes there is no unreasonable function names and all method name are suggestive and apt
0,this was testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate. the code is dry. there is no redundancy in the code.
0,so fresh and so clean clean. this code is too neat to even be dry. too hot to touch. i just still super impressed by the and the video.
0,all the code is in single file as it tests single model and it seems to cover it extensively. it also looks like there no dry issues.
0,code seems to be concise and well written.
1,the code is mostly clear and easy to follow. test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. one exception is the score method. it could be improved by decomposition. the code for set up could be extracted into separate before each block and multiple it statements could be used for testing expectations.
1, no all functions are reasonably long if not too short. no all methods seem about right no but the team could have provided some comments in the score test function as multiple expects are included the code follows ruby guidelines and they used factories efficiently yes the code is dry they have used after each method to achieve it
0,the features work as intended they cover the test cases and edge cases as well.
0,after working through several edge case side effects by hand up hill both ways it looks like all of their bases are covered and edge cases satisfied.
0,the features work as intended
0,since coverage is and the code looks good to me i am assuming it works fine.
0,tried to run the spec test by copying the superb file and that the factory method is inserted i got an error in examples participant email sends an email to the participant failure error assignment by id alignment id participant score get participant score within round failure error scores questionnaire symbol scores repute scores scores questionnaire symbol assessments questions questionnaire symbol
0,running the code manually resulted in the coverage of the object under test.
1,yes all the test written passes. they could have written test to check if self handle is returned if no nil parameter is sent
0,this is very detailed and explains what is done for every tested method. it also contains links to all resources one may require to understand the of the project. great job guys..
0, this is easily the most clear of any testing write up that i have seen to date. it is organized into meaningful sections that follow their test plan and show of their deliverable
0,the page provides clear details about the work and very easy to understand.
0,the is clear and easy to understand.
0,yes it is easy understand that it is testing project and how it is done.
1,under tested methods they have explained everything really nicely. the video is just to long minutes. you have have made it short.
1,team could have given more description on what is the is doing
1,the clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. the authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings. i would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of and unit tests .ncsu.edu oss er unit test description because they are redundant in this context.
0,yes the team has efficiently detailed all the details about the projects and the need for their changes to providing code of their changes. they have also attached coverage and test run screen shots for references.
1,the test plan section is really well written. however pre conditions edge cases are not very well discussed and talked about. i would suggest the team to add these into the as well.
1,magic. how did they know they needed test plan.. they did great job laying out how they created an environment to unit test participant with their design choice and chosen variables and factories.
0,looks like edge cases and invalid inputs are handled.
0,the test plan look complete enough.
0,the plan looks good and it covers lot of cases.
0,the write up does has test plan but looking at the code it seems they have check every edge case. also since there coverage is coming to to be everything should work.
0,the test plan is comprehensive and fully covers all the methods and cases that are part of the object under test. running the test suite yields overall coverage.
0,yes they have come up with all possible inputs edge cases and wrong data entries to check the system behaviour is not faulty
0,for every tested method they explain what they did and why they did it.
0, they even wrote down their plan to accomplish the project. i love it.
0,it is testing task i assume there is not any design needed.
0,it explains clearly what tests are missing and how the coverage is increased.
0,yes they have explained everything.
1,the authors mostly focus on how they did what they did i.e. inner workings of each test suite. little to no discussion is provided on the overall decisions pertaining to design principles and patterns that have been utilized in this project. for example there are no instances of before each blocks in the source code. this decision could be discussed and clarified in the page.
0,they team has thought through efficiently to use design options that avoid test reruns and to dry out some mocks settings
0,the team has not added any test cases.
0,no new tests have been written
0,no test cases test plans
1,unfortunately the test cases are lacking this could be improved before the second submission
0,there is no test plan.
0,test cases are not being taken cared.
0,all the variables and function names used are appropriate.
0,the variables names are well assigned.
1,there large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. an example is that should be exit assignment. additionally some names are not very helpful. for instance the variable from is used for form but why not just use form. there is also lot of written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non intuitive variable names
1,the code is clear and concise. the variable method and class name choice is correct. one variable feel can be changed is top max choosers can be renamed to topic max slots as slots has been used in the function name as well and it will be more consisted
1,for the ruby changes they have made they have used intuitive names and used naming conventions as much as possible. def update feedback some places the variable names are used in whereas few places they were used. few variable names were directly used from legacy code although could have been done. 
1,most of the variable names and function names are named based on proper convention. suggestion function this function name could be changed to maybe or atopic apart form this all other names look good
1,all the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like max team size get participants without team.
0,functions and variables are named aptly
1,ruby coding standard has been followed. only one function has been added in controller as per requirement. code follows dry principle. the team can add comments for the code added which would be useful to understand the code.
1,def create function in assignments controller seems to be long and could have been considering that they used most of the legacy code and most of their work was on ui their part on ruby changes were much
1,the team has written concise and efficient code with proper implementation. however some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend
1,the code is well structured. could have added more comments for easy understanding of the code. the functions are not long.
1,functions are of appropriate length and code is in proper methods. however no comments are provided what so ever.
1,the group has not shared the link for the test environment. hence unable to test the edge cases. however in the screen cast they have covered the mentioned in the requirement document.
0,i have not been supplied with link to manually use an instance with their changes and i have not been able to find link in their pr or write up.
0,i could not run it locally and hence i am not sure about the edge cases. code looks clean and should not break in most of the cases
0,the clearly shows the changes made and works perfectly. since the edge cases agent defined not sure about the of edge cases in this case as it involves ui most of the time
1,there is no link provided to test the code manually. however from the video provided i can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. issue and are working as expected. in issue i could see that the previous version of the add new topic page had topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. suggestion the team could implement that or if already implemented add that to the page to reflect the way in which that is handled
0,the features work as intended. edge cases are properly executed.
0,the code works.
0,no deployment is provided so could test manually.
0,the write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. the team has also added screenshots of the manual testing and the video demonstrating the functionality they added.
0,the write up covers all the issues and is well organized including the code blocks and the screenshots.
1,i was able to understand the changes they were making and why however i thought the write up was little too verbose and had too much code i can find the code in their pr.
0,the documentation is well written and indicated clearly what was the problem tackled and how it was approached and solved
1,the format on how they distinguished the features and explained solutions for each and everything is good. first they give bird eye view of the problems and then deep diving into each problem with solution and screenshot is good. the background explanation given could have been more specific towards their problem statement rather than just about the images tend to occupy the entire page and its little difficult while going through it little could have made their page really good.
0,yes the team has clearly stated the problem statement and the changes they have done to provide solutions to the problem. they have been given problems to which they have clearly provided the names of the files and the part of the code which is changed. the video explains the problem and the implemented solution perfectly without any ambiguity.
0,the write up clearly explains about the modifications made in it indicates the functionality of their work which is topic management and the problem statement is clearly elaborated. it provides the files changed and also the code snippets in which the changes are made. the write up also provides visual representations of the changes made.
0, is very well written contains enough screenshots and explanations of the code.
1,the write up is well explained but could have described more on the methods whey implemented and why did it implement in certain way.
1,the team has not included any test cases. it would be easy to include the test cases on the app controllers suggestion controller for the update feedback method that has been added. also the team may add some features test cases as most of the changes made are in files. the team can refer the existing features present in these features folder.
0,there is no explicit test plan section but all the scenarios are covered with appropriate images.
0,text plan is missing
0,there was no test plan
1,the does not include the test plan as of now but that is the only thing which is left for the team to complete. the team could work on this and try to improve the test coverage.
0,there is no test plan.
0,no test cases or test plan mentioned in the write up.
0,the team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.
1,they explained it well but there were no larger design patterns they seemed to be following. i did think that they used ajax in the appropriate way but it could be improved in the future.
1,their solutions are well explained. the way they have explained attaching screenshot of code snippet and telling this is where we made this change and this is how it works gives better understanding of their project. it could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes where the features where not there. that way the background of the why this feature could have been clear.
1,yes the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. however for the issue some more information about the and some additional comments would improve the solutions to issue and are explained clearly and are easy to follow.
0,design patterns were not used. rest of the code is explained and easy to follow.
1,code snippets are given but need explanation.
0, explains what was to be done and how they did it but does not give rationale behind the way they coded and any alternative approaches.
0,the test plan is not about what they test in the spec test.
0,yes all the test cases are automated. they have reached the goal of coverage.
0,test cases are present.
0,yes all test cases are automated
0,they have not yet reached the desired goal of coverage.
0,everything in the was test.
0,it seems you have cover of the however all checks have failed in the pull request test.
0,yes the admin has included the test plan cases in the automated tests.
0,the authors have implemented every test case that is discussed in the test plan. detailed explanations and code itself is provided in the project page.
0, all variables methods and class names look reasonable.
0,it follows the standard ruby practices. all the variables methods and class name look reasonable. the added tests looks very clean
0,naming conventions are followed. test coverage has increased.
0,coverage has increased by percent overall
0,the added tests look very clean.
0,pull request build passes well and there are no issues.
1,most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard ruby practices. one problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names with numbers. example allow receive topical return topic here it is not clear what distinguishes participant from other participants and why it is special. it would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu sort by name method line. furthermore i would suggest using consistent indentation for authorization method line.
1,the code looks clean. though i don understand why you have used this line in the test for responses puts maps. i feel some of the code that needed is commented out. please remove this code as it was mentioned in the details. naming and seem to be fine.
0,the code looks clean. however some of the comments are not provided for the test cases. apart from this the naming and the conventions seem to be fine
0, of correct length.
0,does not apply as its testing project with most written in single spec file to test the functionality
1,the test for sort by name redundant checks implementation parts. it needs only to test the result.
0, bot reports style issues which is an awful lot.
1,there is no need to use the student and participant.
0,well the code looks good and very much follows the ruby style guide. the code also is dry. it looks well written and does not any changes.
1,the code is concise and readable. it consists of mostly small methods that test one thing. one exception sort by name method where several assertions are made in one method. it would be better to use several it statements and dry out the code by utilizing before each statement. one further suggestion would be to shorten the code by using one array statements instead of individual expressions. for example replace stu build student name student stu build student name student stu build student name student with studentship build student name student
0,yep the superb file works fine. i think only handle method been tested. this is why the coverage seems to be
0,yes all the features work as intended. the participant that is created using the build method describes participant as an instance of the assignment participant class. i observed the handle method has not been tested yet.
0,video covers how to run the test cases which are clear and understandable.
0,tests work
0,some cases haven been implemented yet.
0,tests in the file pass according to the video but less than coverage implies that corner cases are being handled.
0,no the test failed.
0,yes after testing the work manually i could see that their features are working as intended.
1,features implemented in this project work as intended. after running the code manually i am getting the same coverage as stated on the page. one problem is that the main object under test participant is created using build method. describes participant as an instance of class. there is possibility that this is complicating test cases or will complicate them in the future. the solution is to either define new participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the code itself.
1,the is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project. in my opinion i think the code for every test is not required. it is enough to explain the structure and code for one test maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests. that should suffice.
0,the document contains the whole information including the test plans and the the environment setup. it is neatly documented as well which makes it more readable
1,project purpose is write test cases for participant model and increase the test coverage. this seems to be easily understandable but plan of work should mainly concentrate on how we test this functionality rather than just mentioning that test cases need to be written.
1,the doc says model is changed. however that file is not currently committed. however assignment participant model file is committed. seems to be some mismatch at one of the places. correcting it will help in understanding what work is done and how does it impact the functionality.
0,the write is very descriptive and included code from both the model and the spec file.
0,the explains how the tests relate to their respective methods.
0,very clearly 
0,it is well written quite understandable. it clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. i can understand what the project is about.
1,the problem being addressed by this project is defined cogently without any ambiguities. test cases are considered separately starting with description of the given method followed by how the functionality is being tested. i would suggest removing parts like description wiki.ncsu.edu user talk shaky and rationale behind using spec wiki.ncsu.edu user talk shaky unit testing with spec because those parts fall out of the scope of this topic.
1,the test plan does not include details on preconditions or edge cases. i suggest the team to elaborate on test plan. otherwise good start.
0,yes the test appears complete as they have mentioned all from setting up the environment to the tests that they have implemented along with the plan of the they executed their project
0,test plan is not included however they have included the test cases implemented and the is good.
1, a more through explanation of what each does will be useful. its documented well about what the will return but not what it does. mentioning that will be useful
1,the test plan could be more specific. for example writing testing conditions for different functions does indicate what strategies are being employed or what edge cases are being tested.
0,the document states they have loc coverage but the assignment description states they need at least. this is not complete.
0,yes the test plan looks complete and includes all the test cases and the actions.
1,scenarios that are discussed in the have comprehensive descriptions and justifications. however clearly number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is. i would suggest using mock objects which will both tests from database and increase the overall coverage. for example mocking find by method of would allow covering participant team case allow .to receive find with user return team another minor issue is that is missing some cases that are implemented in the code team scores.
1,they have mentioned that they use factory but it been mentioned clearly how they use factories. it would be great if they can incorporate this in the 
0,yes the have mentioned all of the required work and its related explanation. they have reasoned out their exact methods and the issues to be considered while testing in the problem statement.
0, have been tested properly.
0, looks good. explains what work is done and what is the corresponding output
0,the explains why the tests they write relate to their respective methods but does justify loc coverage which is below the requirements for the project.
0,yes the explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. they have put video explanation of the same.
1,authors describe the strategy they utilized for tackling the project and the detailed mechanics of each test case. however there is no mention of specific design decisions or patterns that were used in the implementation. my suggestion is for the team to elaborate on technical decisions made for simplifying test cases for example the majority of mock objects is created at the beginning before every it statement.
0,the test plan was not present. but the team have done good job in implementing tests.
0,yes it looks they have converted all the cases into the test plan.
0,the test cases have been developed into automated tests however edge cases or failing cases have not been considered. only simple and straightforward scenarios have been tested. the video shows the test cases and the document shows the coverage. the document is well made.
0,good work on including test cases. the app works fine after testing.
0,yes most of them but they have not added any automated integration tests. unit testing has been done and is great to see such detailed tests
0,all the test plan is converted to automated testing.
0,they did not have test plan.
0,the variable and method names are apt.
1,class and variables are name correctly. get bookmark rating response map is an not an apt name for function. the word bookmark can be omitted in function and variable names inside the bookmark student requests bookmark it should show bookmark test is failing
0,yes. the variables have been very keenly named. especially in the file the variables are very accurately and effectively named as there could have been much confusion otherwise. kudos for that.
0,all methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. only some of the code changes are explained and reason of taking particular problem solving approach is lacking.
0,the variables methods and class names are aptly named. i could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.
1,build fails pls look into it. has been replaced by but the earlier naming convention just by looking at the name let the reader understand the data structure being used. i would have liked similar approach here.
0,the code follows standards.
0,use of few variables is hard to understand. for e.g. otherwise most variables and classes are aptly named.
0,the code follows the dry principle.
1,the code follows most of the standard practices except the rd one. it does falls short of comments. it took very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in particular file does. this scenario could be improved in the future iterations.
1,more comments are needed because i had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. the code follows ruby style guide and is dry in its design. functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. good work in this area.
0,great work. clearly understandable. functions are of appropriate length codes are in appropriate methods code is very well commented code follows ruby style guide. good naming.
1,function names look good. and most of them have len which is good. the tests make use of contexts effectively. this is great to see. yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does.
1,code is clean and variable names are readable. need bit of formatting as some lines are not aligned well.
0, the code is well written follows ruby guidelines and functions are of appropriate length. no comments are provided what so ever making the huge code change very difficult to follow.
0,they do work as intended.
1,cases mentioned seem to be working fine. can be bit descriptive about the steps though.
0,all of the features mentioned by the author works successfully in the demonstration as well as in the manual tests performed by me.
1,the features work as intended however i am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. could have made demo video showing the improvements or step guide to follow.
0,could not detect any flaws. works exactly as it has been been in the good guidance.
1,yes. i suggestion since they deployed the code and video it would have been good if they put view of the ui usage similar to what they have put as screen shots in the code.
0,tested in the links given the changes are working correct. the server is up and i was able to reflect the steps mentioned.
0,i can find where is the bookmarks page but according to their screenshots i think their features work well.
1,the write ups been written well. a small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.
0,the seems apt. i had little problem understanding the solution to problem but otherwise it seems fine
0,the write up is very clear and directs user to the main issue very well. the flow is very structured in the sense that first it gives high level view of what is it then tells about the book mark functionality and then tells the problem and how they came up with the solution. one of the most professional i ve reviewed.
1,the method names and variable names are very well defined. the best i have seen so far. no clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. only file names are stated along with changes made. why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.
0,the is clear. it is easy to understand what the project does.
1,write up is good. great job. however i could find few points that if rectified would make it even better. it would be good if the problem statement could list the issue that are being fixed. that would make it easier to navigate instead of pasting screen shot for solution it would have been good if few words detailing approach would be put. post that screen shot could be put.
0,write up clearly explains with screenshots what is done. however does not say how the changes have been implemented.
0,the test plan is not there.
0,they have included test model video in which all the test are passing. it looks complete
0,yes. the test plan is present in the also the links to videos for the demonstration was particularly helpful too.
1,the test plan was comprehensive. however in the video they could have explained which screens and which methods they were testing instead of just showing some test cases pass on the screen.
0,the authors considered different pre conditions edge cases invalid input values and other possibilities and clearly well written. test plan looks complete
0,yes i followed the link to check the tests and they have tested the controllers.
0, looks exhaustive and is explained well.
0,they don have test plan section but they added some screenshots of the test result i can see they have pretty good path coverage. but i can not know if they test edge cases or invalid input values without seeing their test plan.
1,the is well written. but i feel there are some missing details about the project. the team could elaborate on the issues in the project and the solution that they have implemented. this way it would better in understanding how and why the authors did the work that they did.
0,it mentions what they did but does highlight why they chose to implement that way. don seem to have implemented any design pattern as well.
1,the clearly enough what the authors did. though the part of why the authors did what they did in elaborated with much depth. from the authors perspective the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive but for person reviewing the article who does have much background of the problem at hand the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is.
1,the authors do not explain why they did the word the way they did. entirely new pages have been created with no indication as to why those pages were needed. old redundant code has been commented but not deleted. naming and code pattern wise very good job.
0, does not mention anything about how the code works alternative strategies possible or strategies they used.
1,the write up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. the rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned neither are any of the principles mentioned. it has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.
1,no. i think the authors should have mentioned why particular solution was taken. what was the main driving force for taking the approach that they have taken. this was entirely missing. pls work on that. they could also remove much of the commented code.
0,yes the problem statement was explained thoroughly. also the team very aptly described why the issue needs to be fixed. great work.
1,i didn find any information about how and why they did the work they only show me what are the issues and the results after they fixed these issues for example in problem they told me their is an average rating metric bug and they fixed the bug but they said nothing about how they fixed the bug.
0,the write up was splendid. all instructions were written thoroughly. i did not face any problem in understanding. also screenshots guided well
0,there was no test plan. also all the test cases don seem to have been written which is evident since the code coverage percent.
0,all the cases in test plan are included in the automated tests.
0,edge cases are covered as well.
0,yes the admin has included the test plan cases in the automated tests. they have solved all the issues they were tasked with.
0,they have added spec and unit tests
0,the build is passing the test coverage and the bullet points mentioned in the issues section have been properly implemented to achieve the desired result. all the issues have been implemented as discussed.
0,test not passed
0,the made by the author seemed to follow most of the guidelines that professional programmer should follow. the variable names were unambiguous and clearly stated what they stood for. also the functions and classes did what they stated.
0,the names are very intuitive and one can easily understand the reason for each of the variables from their names. in addition the test coverage has increased however it is not very good.
1,the test code follows standards. context messages can be shorter and precise.
0,all the names suggest the functions well.
0,the code for the export file controller and models for question advice are tested adequately with the questionnaires controller sec model file. the variables methods and class names follow the general standard ruby practices.
1,except the comments everything seemed to be fine. the code seemed to lack proper comments and as result of which it took several seconds to determine why the author did what he did. apart from that the code seemed perfect. functions were sufficiently long and code was dry enough too.
0,the code overall seems dry. the functions are to the point and the code follows ruby style guide.
0,they have added new test cases and hence code is not dry.
1,the team should add more comments for the codes include in the two issues it is little bit hard to follow what the author want to do without comments.
1,the code contributed by the author contains long functions which are adequate and consistent considering the amount of task that is carried by each function. the team could improve upon the comments to enable high understanding of the flow of code written. the code does follow the ruby style guide and supports the dry principle.
1,the authors work seems to work fine in theory. but unfortunately the link provided by the author does not work and hence there was no way to manually test it. but the demonstration video provided was big thumbs up.
0,deployed link is not working
1,the was clear enough to be understood by anyone familiar with developing or contributing on it provided high level view and then dug deep into implementation which is great since it saves time and also look concise. but for someone outside the domain of it feels too sudden of transition that it takes time and in many cases other resources to figure out why the author did what he did. but the overall flow and structure was very great.
1,excellent the instructions were clear. the screenshots were apt. one suggestion could be shorter and precise.
1,the document clearly explains not only the problem statement but also what actually is. it proceeds to explain how they solved the problem of the rubric criteria.
1,yes the author did include test plans and test cases. also the test cases seem sufficiently exhaustive to cover most of the edge cases.
1,yes the tests are thorough. needs some formatting in the code.
1,the team has added test case for just one scenario. there is no test plan. it is advisable to add more test cases for all the methods in the sub classes to check if the existing functionality is not breaking.
1,the test is explained with the file used in the tabular form. it would have been good to attach screenshot of the test if possible.
1,they discussed just test case and did implement it. some more corner cases can be thought of.
1,the query is well mentioned but i would suggest the sql be mentioned in the below manner for code clarity. select.. from table name where condition
1,almost all variable and method names are well defined. suggestion try to reactor method render report in module by using hash instead of really long case when statements.
1,review response map can be extract the various function and write new methods for each.
1,the code is well written but few more comments before every function could have made it easier to understand the code.
1,the features do work as per the mentioned there are some suggestions mentioned and would be good to include test cases for the same in future.
1,no link to the application or of manual testing. suggestion you can try to add screenshots of the testing performed and attach it to the 
1,yes the does explain the well. could have been better to have more attributes in the subclasses in the diagram. this could help the user know about the details of the strategy pattern used.
1,the test is added under the test added section and is well explained under the tabular form. could have produced screenshot of the test if it was possibility to generate. this helps the future teams to know what kind of test result to expect.
1,edge cases missing from the test case. write more test cases with invalid input types. example give string to an int type and raise an error accordingly.
1,since the project involved deletion of obsolete methods and sql it would be good to explicitly state in the test plan if there were any tests previously that used these methods sql. also if they are present they need to be modified.
1,authors have converted test plan into an appropriate test case. suggestion the authors can improve the if they elaborate more on the testing approach used for the newly added code.
1,the team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding pictorial representation of the pattern used. however it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the page. as it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented. in this way the comparing code with the original code in can be avoided.
1,yes very well written. i would have given full marks if you would have added code snippet and screenshot of the before and after feature. visually it would have been great to understand the changes quickly.
1,it would be good if the functionality of the obsolete methods that were removed during the is mentioned and also explain why they were obsolete.
1,there are any test cases listed in the can explain the test cases bit in the commit message.
1,testing has been done well. testing could have been more extensive. currently the system only tests if the responses are correct for proper input. blank or no input or failing cases should also have been tested.
1,no cases were mentioned in the test plan hence could not tell it is converted into automated tests. please elaborate it.
1,naming looks fine. could probably have used is submitted. instead of is submitted.
1,all methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. the vm question response table could have been named edited to be named in more descriptive way. i do not understand what is the meaning of vm.
1,everything looks fine except for few places where there are issues with indentation.
1,a small suggestion new feedback author new feedback the variables methods and class names are aptly named. i could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.
1,grades the parameter id is not descriptive enough. please consider changing it to be more descriptive.
1,include test cases for negative scenarios as well.
1,the code has comments at the beginning of the functionality. could have added some more comments where the functions are larger for can add why certain change in the fetching process was made so that next time it can be referred while coding further.
1,the team has done well to follow the ruby style guide and has ensured to keep the code dry. however my suggestion is to add comments in the code for the reader to follow the code easily.
1,the comments were sparse. maybe coming up with few words before every method would make the project more understandable.
1,build is failing. correct it by understanding the reason. good job on ruby standards for the naming convention.
1,the code seems to work for basic required functionality. need to add more number of edge cases with test results where there is possibility of failure and look into the work around is required.
1,the author work runs smoothly. it could have been better had they provided short demo video. i could not figure out where were the changes made in the system. they could have written the navigation steps. directly giving the flow without any context is tough to understand.
1,i would only suggest you to add more comments to your code. i know that no comments were previously added for you to feed off of but i guess major aspect of these oss projects is to add as many comments as possible to the existing code.
1,method remove instructor is written twice in the same file delete it.
1,team has written professional and understandable formatting is good. with good explanation of the approach taken to solve the issue. creative way of writing before and after of the code snippet. team could have added pictures to make it more relatable for users new with 
1,well explained. add screenshot of the changes which can help understand the change visually.
1,the was written well enough to how and what the project does. the only suggestion is to include screenshots. that would make the write up even more easy to understand.
1,difficult to test and review the work one since there were no screenshots provided. i was not able to find an instance of review which could be submitted as team but not by individual members of the team. some of the crash after clicking on particular assignment to view the review report. suggestions the team could explain steps to access the review view so that manual testing could be done. the team could create dummy assignments for testing. maybe adding screenshots would help in the process.
1,the document clearly explains what was the problem and what was the solution they have also compared and contrasted with the previous solution which is good. they have talked about how different roles come into play with respect to security perspective and what the pros and cons of having not having those roles. comparing the code changes gave clearer view of the code changes. one improvement could be in the background part. taking it as it was the majority of the project was related to solving issues regarding the deletion of administrator and instructor accounts. administrator and instructor are both account types that inherit behavior from user but are handled and deleted in different furthermore properties are used on user that are on an administrator such as team ids or course associations the different could have been shown to get better view screenshot considering it wasnt within the problem scope although why these properties agent on administrator is defined in the forthcoming sessions it was little unclear while reading it. it could have been quoted that as we will see it in the forthcoming sections
1,yes test plan is complete enough also team has explained the test plan technology to used to achieve it. good knowledge of capybara testing. team could have added test scenarios for each issue step by step rather than single lines.
1,the test plan is missing in the page. the content in this section could be the one suggested in the above comment to just include all the test cases added and write brief description about each.
1,i think their introduction and issue sections clearly shows what functionality the work is related to they also add some screenshots which help me understand what they have done. but i can not understand what is bookmark and what it is used for i think it is difficult for someone like me who have not used bookmark to understand these with only short description. if they can write something more about bookmarks it will be better.
1,include the code snippet in the write up as well.
1,test plan is included in the section. they have explained about the basic test cases and how it is implemented. edge cases invalid input values agent explained in the .
1,the authors concisely explain the work they did. as suggestion i would ask them to include the tests written in the page as well. the idea is for any reader to understand what all happened in the project without looking at the code.
1, yes they have test section. the amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. keep it up however i would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of heir unit tests. i see mostly the ve test cases being handled in the tests.
1,the includes their thinking methodology and why they arrived at that solution. changes under user deletion clearly explains what went wrong in the existing code and what should be added. one suggestion would be instead of showing before and after they could have leveraged git ui version of in red and green to have shown the differences. but before after way worked too.
1,the explanation is quite good to tell what is the current and the required functionality. the screenshots placed are not complete as in they cut the code at the right end. instead i would suggest to placed the link to the code changes so that the becomes shorter and you can explain each code change better in the . also the reviewer can compare the code with your explanation properly if he has the link to the code.
1,the write up is okay but could be bit more descriptive. could have provided screen shots of the changes to help reader understand better. no initial instructions on where to get started.
1,this project is on implementing single rejoinder per team for reviews instead of per participant reviews and also makes the feedback link for reviews more accessible. the explained the background about and the motivation for the project. it then moved on to list the tasks that were implemented and files that were modified in the project. it showed the current and new implementation clearly. the however could have quoted the tests done using spec and the ui instead of plainly mentioning the that the tests were modified to suit the current implementation.
1,i was able to understand what the project does to certain extent. the could have been more elaborate with views snapshots of the page before and after the changes. it adequately indicated what functionality the work is related to.
1,the team has mentioned the problem statement and the methods which they have implemented to solve the problem. however there is difficulty to follow the workflow since there are no screenshots attached or any video link provided. the team could improve this by adding screenshot of the updated workflow below the changes shown in the 
1,the team has written well structured write up but it lacks depth in certain areas. there is need for more background on what an author feedback is. the project description gives better idea. please try to include details from there. the last sentence under the motivation head you should change this to list the team collective feedback to its reviewers to particular assignment is bit confusing. please rephrase the sentence so as to add clarity to it. instructions on how to manually test the functionality is missing. it was difficult to figure out how to navigate to and test the functionality. it would be really helpful to add this in the 
1,there is separate testing section in the but it does not have much explanation. could have added couple of test case explanations. also screenshot of passed test case could work wonders.
1,the authors have considered various preconditions but edge cases are not tested. no test plan has been provided. some tests have been edited to meet the new requirements. many conditions have been checked using if else cases which could have been more elegant.
1,the test plan section just states that the existing test cases for feedback per member is fixed to satisfy the new feedback per team implementation. it would have been effective if specific pre conditions edge cases invalid input values etc are handled. for example in this case the input with missing team id or one member teams can be used as good candidates to test the implementation.
1,the test plan does not look complete. it just says fixed the existing test cases for the review feedback by team instead of team member. could have mentioned the edge cases and how they tested it.
1,the authors have just mentioned that the test cases were updated. it would be good if the code diff for the test case modification were also provided so that we get an idea about the kind of changes made.
1,the mentions about the changes done in the code but not how and why it was done. instead the team could explain each code change more and give link to the code change from 
1,could have been more elaborate no mention of design principles or patters used.
1,the team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes. however would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write up. this would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow.
1,the write up has detailed how the author has done the changes. but it fails to address why the particular direction was taken in some cases. it would be good to elucidate on that as well. in solutions implemented.. section it would be good to include the names of the files before each code snippet and not just the description so that it is easier for the reader to relate.
1,the test cases are cleanly written following good practices. some of the indentation needs to be adjusted to contain better readability. also within the menu file you are essentially testing two classes node and menu. i am not sure why that is. is the node class and inner class of menu. maybe these two classes should be separated into different spec files to ensure better naming setup. maybe this could be clarified in the so that readers would understand the design choice. overall great work.
1,most of the codes are well strutted but something like returns an equivalent item is long and it is better to separate them.
1,the team has introduced the functions clearly but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself. besides the motivation is general add some specific details for this project would be better. as far as i am concerned for the functionality of the menu the introduction is also little bit general. adding more details about what the function of the menu so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough.
1,the overall purpose of the project the need for mocks stubs and the scenarios of each test case are very well presented however there is little explanation about why certain tests were implemented in any particular fashion. it would be nice addition to include few of your test cases and explain your reasoning behind why how you implemented that test case. adding this would further clarify your design testing plan choices and make for fantastic read.
1,please make sure code like puts x is avoided. remove them and commit the code again. builds are failing. see the travis ci build details and code climate errors and fix them
1,function variable names are ok but there were ruby coding style issues like not using blocks not keeping code concise and not following ruby syntax. scripts for converting non files is good approach.
1, convert if nested inside else to unused variable key inside remove non method.
1, no function length is good no. they are apt. comments are not included which makes it hard to follow as the changes are not regarding functionality rather than system implementation comments should have been elaborate and detailing why the change is done yes they did no. the code was dry and reused efficiently
1,cannon test the code as the application is not opening and the videos unloaded are binary files.
1, is not working. also the video is not running please unload in 
1,the written explanation is good. add few screenshots of the change to be able to understand the changes done visually.
1,yes it explains with clarity the issue at hand only support how that causes trouble. also improper formatting of tags.
1,the document directly dives into issue they could have provided more information on different scenarios that are currently facing the said issue and its magnitude. this could have been helpful to counteract the problem in the future in other scenarios
1,they have included test plan but few examples and screenshot of their work would have been plus point.
1,testing is done manually and there is mention of automated tests in the but no files are seen. it better to provide all links like code testing videos and while submitting on 
1,the folders binary files in the drive cannon be played. can you unload the video on so that it is easy for everyone.
1,yes it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear.
1,proper naming conventions are followed for variables and methods and classes. the only thing i think can be improved is dummy names for files and 
1,there are some duplicate codes could substitute with before statement. for example line are exactly the same with line it is better to use before even if there is only one line duplicate.
1,overall the team has done good job in maintaining ruby style guide. the team could add more comments and reduce code redundancy in scores method.
1,i feel that they have achieved test coverage although the design principles or patterns used haven been listed. listing that would help understand the testing strategy used.
1,since it a test project there are not much design patterns to follow but they should list what tech they used to test the rb file.
1,the authors mention that they have followed dry testing practices but there are few test cases where they have not implemented it. for example scores questions method. i would recommend to make the use of factories. overall well written test cases.
1,the test plan is too elaborate and does exactly cover different pre conditions edge cases invalid input values and other possibilities under the corresponding headers. please include this as it improves the readability and understanding.
1,the has all the relevant information though i feel it needs to be bit more organized. the titles and order need to change. the content needs to be placed at proper places. for example test plan lists all the test cases and code which according to me should be covered in the implementation.
1,the talk about what they have done throughly it could be better if they have mention about how they do that.
1,the describes briefly and clearly what the class does in the project. it has also given the details on the test plan test cases and explained the use of spec testing framework and factories. i would suggest to add link to their video that shows the tests running in the page. all in all good work.
1,there is no test plan yet implemented in the documentation. be sure that when you include this section that you make the inclusions specific and intentional.
1,the team has not included test plan that models their tasks for running the test cases. it should list the overall procedure adopted by the team from scratch to getting the tests running.
1,i am unable to find the file review response map spec in the repo that was supplied. however there was ruby file that was attached in the submission. the variable names are also clear and unambiguous. this file is incomplete but the tests that are complete seem to follow appropriate syntax and guidelines. i would suggest to add some describe and context blocks that would clarify the purpose of each test case rather than just have the it statement saying the name of the method being tested. keep working to finish up the remaining tests in this fashion and it would be great.
1,the functionality added to the pull request is reasonable and makes use of appropriate keywords. it could be improved by giving names according to convention like feed back review response map could just be feed back as jt is part of the review response map model file.
1,the code seems to set up large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case. it is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods. it would be helpful if explanation for the code was given. when using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class. the code not very dry. in many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to before all or before each block.
1,except the lack of comments in the code the code seems to be perfectly fine. could be improved in that scenario.
1,as mentioned in the above comment add these describe and context statements to further comment on the purpose of your test cases. this makes it easier to understand the why the test is there i also find that it helps to clarify to the developer that the test is necessary.
1,the code written by the team includes the basic functionality needed to run the test cases. some improvements might include keeping function short like diving the import function into multiple contexts or reducing redundant code by using the mock built.
1,many tests are not yet implemented. more testing of the author work in handling edge cases will be done in round two of reviews.
1,i believe the is not complete. however the content that is included so far does aid in the explanation of the project purpose. more elaboration and completion of additional sections such as the testing design and implementation of tests will help to fully clarify the project purpose to the reader.
1,the is sufficient in itself but not as exhaustive or easy to understand from the perspective if an outsider. the author could have elaborated more on the problem statement and how it related with also instead of directly jumping to the implementation the author could have explained little bit more about why and what was the approach taken by the author.
1,the write up can be improved by explaining all the methods which are tested
1,the document for the project does not provide enough details about the project and the task performed by the team. it contains of only rough overview of the project at this stage. it does not reveal much about the functionality of the program.
1,there is not specific test plan section in the there is work to be done section that discusses the work that should be completed for project success. i would suggest rearranging or rename this section and continue to describe your plan of attack for testing.
1,there is section titled test plan. however it does not seem to be plan or give an outline for the development of the code. instead it describes what the methods do but shows the testing code for the method. this is confusing as no explanations are given for the coding design.
1,the does not include the test plan section. it is suggested that the team add the section and include number of different aspects such as specifying the edge cases and preconditions considered while working on the test cases.
1,little explanation for the code is given. the only case in which code is explained comes in the section titled test plan under the subsection mock instance. here it is mentioned that the project uses mocks to aid in testing functionality. however the code example is actually of factories different but related concept. it is unclear if this is typo or misunderstanding because in later code snippets mocks do appear.
1,the lists the task to be performed under the work to be done section. it enlists the criteria required to be achieved as part of the project submission. the team can adopt workflow that can give details about how the team managed to reach the current implementation such as understanding the files involved steps taken for setting the environment etc.
1,covered all the edge cases but have not provided any explanation.
1,there are some instances of variable names that are with numbers for example answer questionnaire etc. while this approach can be justified in some cases i would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. for example team could be used instead of team because that is the only team instance variable in the source code.
1,the code does follow all the standards and steps to cover all the test cases. could include some more comments to make the code self explanatory.
1,the source code is mostly following standard ruby practices but there is room for improvement. firstly the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out. i would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability. given chunks can always be retrieved via commit history. secondly some application level objects like answer or criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks. it would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision.
1,code is nicely written and runs well. however more edge cases should be included. for example each function should be tested for known success case and an edge case or potential failure.
1,the looks too long with lot of code. it does have all the code and test cases but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the . this will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallel
1,the page is divided into some nice sections however the authors have just included the code as it is without any description of the work that they have done.
1, its good write up additionally you could try to explain method and test rather than including all the test cases
1,the defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem. raw code is copied from review response mark and review response map superb files however this does not give the reader any useful information. i would suggest replacing the review response mark code with short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite. furthermore the team can provide listing of higher level method descriptions from review response map superb what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result. one minor improvement would be removing parts like description .ncsu.edu csc ece fall e. write unit tests for review response mark background because it is redundant in this context.
1,as this rubric calls for the need of section test plan i suggest adding it and including the work done in that section along with why particular test has been written.
1,the test plan is not defined formally in the instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. given test suite covers every method of the object under test. coverage is achieved. it would be better for the team to define the test plan and it from the actual code. this could be done by firstly stating all the describe constructs methods that they are testing and secondly elaborating by listing their descriptions.
1,all the are listed and code also attached for the same. but if the code changes were highlighted in color as in git then its better comparable.
1,the page is divided into some great sections that provide details about the project. i appreciate that the team provided actual code along with explanation of the test to afford the reader deeper understanding. the first paragraph in the design section is bit hard to follow. it would be helpful to have this explanation accompanied by the tests these stubs were associated with and or the actual implementation of these stubs for better grasp of their purpose. i would recommend combining the test and design sections for easier flow of reading and following test implementations. thank you for the results section of the that wraps up the project and is an easy point of reference for the reader to see the outcome of the project.
1,the does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project. one thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. the team could provide rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.
1,the for this project contains tons of useful information about testing and spec i am not sure that some of it needs to be explained to the current extent example what unit testing and add is or the environment set up. they are nice to include but maybe less as the purpose of the project is not to educate on those topics. overall this did an outstanding job of describing the purpose of the project.
1,i felt the section conditions tested in menu could have been more verbose.
1,the code follows the dry principle and the ruby style guide for writing the test cases. the code could be improved by providing comments. the code contains optimum length methods and the variables and functions have been properly named.
1,the tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior functionality. like for in this scenario the controller action attribute of the menu item is unavailable. in this case the expectation is that customized path is assigned to the variable. this just specifies what variable is being updated and i have no idea what workflow it represents. this is at least brittle description for test. suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value while the test it self might pass if the change was passive the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests.
1,the menu test case violates the dry principle. the team can make use of factories to get rid of code redundancy. overall good work.
1,all the names are intuitive and reasonable apart from drop topic deadline. the team need to change this variable name to something more precise other than that good job following naming conventions.
1,some functions have the same code deleted and added again which could ve been avoided like schema line lines and more lines similarly in that file
1,in the code topic id and drop topic deadline name does seems to follow the ruby guide line and you should probably name them differently like first topic id and first drop topic deadline.
1,none of the functions are too long could find changes where dry principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines although the code is easy to follow the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing. good job.
1,more comments are needed.
1,this section of the is currently missing. when you write this section be sure to state why you tested certain cases in particular fashion accompanied with code examples so that the reader can clearly see what was done.
1,the information provided is good but the page is not organised and the code is confusing. team should work on improving the format of content the way they are representing info.
1,yes the project is to do things. stop teams from dropping assignments very late close to deadline. have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. the should be created on page and not on pedia site.
1,the code you have added in the write up in indented its hard to understand this way. you need to make the write up more readable.
1,the is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. the screenshots can be included in the and the code pasted in the documentation could be formatted. the team also need to include the test plan section in the . apart from this the team did great work.
1,good but lacks readability. the code is directly copy pasted in the approach section. you could have used the pseudo code with proper explanations. the structure and formatting should be improved.
1,write up does include test plan. good thing would be include the testing steps they have performed. few screenshots would be helpful as well.
1, does has test plan but in the video they have tested lot. also please add audio as well in your video explaining what you are doing and why so that its easy for the user to understand otherwise watching minutes silent videos is just to much.
1,i don see any new tests
1,crashed for me once randomly. might be not because of these changes but i am not sure
1,set proposer is setter but appears to be used as better
1,authors could use empty. instead of checking united another thing that the authors have taken care of mails but what if the someone needs to non mails. attribute copy of all does not look like good name it would be nice if they could rename it to email copy all or so this help in reader understand as well as in ide intelligence code coverage has decreased
1,commented out code should be removed at least one example found in participant superb also there are some indentation issues as well as other issues flagged by otherwise the code seems to comply with the ruby style guide and be fairly dry.
1,the code is appropriate but additional comments would make the code much more readable
1,comments in code are missing. there are few lines that need to be removed but still exist it would be nice to delete those eg function length looks okay most functions have len lines which is an acceptable number. since the code is implementing very specific issues over it has specific local changes. other change are okay and ruby like
1,the background and problem statement are clear and concise. the description of the implementation is thorough but little too detailed. it relies too much on the source code and not enough on figures and written explanation.
1,the write up is well written along with the screenshots attached for the code changes which helps in explaining the issues and changes made to solve those. just one suggestion if you are explaining all the steps and redirection for some issues changes please keep the content consistent for other issues changes as well.
1,problem is well defined but the authors have listed issues that need to be fixed but they have only provided links in the problem statement. it will be nice if they can give the link to the third as well.
1,the why part is missing for the code changes. what does each code line of change do. maybe you ll can incorporate that.
1,the was fairly specific on how the solution was implemented although more qualitative description should have replaced the source code dumps. the barely explained why the improvements were needed focusing on what was implemented.
1,more of what is done is explained. also steps to manually test the instance could have been included.
1,yes authors have an details about code changes that they have done and why they have done. i would have liked more emphasis on why
1,you could have made the empty method end on one line. i think arms could be named arms
1,the testing of initiative is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion. however all other tests are not discussed. when looking at the it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon. the test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose. it would be helpful to include more of the test cases. if anything it would be good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initiative because that section of the is very well presented.
1,there is no test plan section at this time. however the authors did include some discussion of edge cases and the fact that the initiative function required testing of known success case and potential failure. i think that this is sufficient without the inclusion of test plan section. i would suggest that since this rubric calls for the section to just rearrange the content of your current page. also include the additional edge cases that you have already tested for in the other functions possibly with some specific examples. this will allow for more thorough test plan section.
1,the pseudo code test plan does good job of explaining the functionality of the tests without being clogged up by implementation details. i do suggest putting it closer to the top of the page though.
1,this does apply here much as its just writing however some of the tests documented in menu like mean with role and without role are confusing. i had to look through the entire doc to figure out why is that written that way. it could be better to have comments as to why particular test is written what does it test and why is the expected output the way it is.
1,does not apply instead of using names like temp and temp more significant name which is self explanatory of its content will be useful.
1,spec code looks comments and good variable name usage are things will suggest to improve. very good work overall.
1, no they have well. no they could have provided more comments on tests where they set nodes at few places. they could have used factories more extensively due to various mock data they might have needed to cover different inputs their code can be more dry as they seem to repeat in all places
1,their tests are very straight forward and can be extended to test few edge cases
1,the whole page is complete and neat while it might be easier to understand if they reorder the test plan with other parts of the page.
1,test plan is given appreciable thought and team has also implemented test scenarios mainly in student task controller superb would suggest team to try and increase test coverage.
1,i could only see commits with no significant file changes. i would request team to add and contribute the changes as soon as possible. with the present changed code methods names and variables and class names are proper with reasonable naming conventions.
1,link to the pull request is missing. please add it.
1,the variables methods and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. in some cases they could have used little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app helpers student task they could have used background colour instead of run as variable name in the due date color method. it will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the 
1, all task vs student tasks the name all task does not sound appropriate. it should be student all tasks. all tasks student all tasks. student tasks student available tasks. current student tasks student current tasks. past student tasks student past tasks also the filename will magnate array fire seems misleading to me. a better name would have been support array pagination also i am not sure this file should be in the as it is just require statement. may be this should be included in the places where the pagination is required instead of loading it during app 
1,in due date color switch case would have been better approach then if else if block. lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. follow mac architecture.
1, the functions seem to be implemented in good manner and the code seems to be dry. in some cases though the authors could have improved as in the app helpers student task file. in side the due date color method they could have used case expressions in ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be more ruby on rails way of doing it. as it will reduce the lines of code as well as being more elegant way of handling it.
1,in the due date color due date instead of the color vs interval it would have been more useful if those are pulled from config file. that will make the implementation more flexible similar found in. list student tasks per page. breaking word wrap breaking word wrap student use of cos element could have avoided by using simple cos class. such stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements which could have been avoided. hr style height px border none color e background color e also the ui changes are not showing up properly aligned. please see the attached screenshot
1,i feel some comments can be added before every function for the code to be understood better.
1,can not find any video or link or ip address link to manually test the changes. i would request team to deploy the changes so that we can test the system partially.
1,can test as the link to the deployed application is not given nor the video link is provided. please include either of them.
1,student dashboard please see the dashboard. the ui elements are not properly aligned. the title current assignments is not where it should be.
1, is readable and written properly. team could have added code snippet and pictures of changed or improved functionality. also team could work upon formatting and could also add links and references.
1,the documentation has been updated. all the information has been documented in neat and logical manner. the write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. the project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.
1,the is clear. it is easy to understand what the project does. it would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.
1,it feels like test plan only covers one aspect changing of the background color for tasks as we approach the deadline. here are other aspects which can be automated for testing perhaps by spec or the likes add past due assignments to the student task list on student view. verify if they are being added saved check for correction in due dates of assignments when an assignment due date is edited it should be appropriately moved from the past assignments list to the current assignments list if needed check if the functionality works. on student task page separate the list of teamed with students from the current tasks box. test if this works write the required tests before implementing the methods in the above mentioned classe
1,yes explains the approach taken by team to solve the issue theoretically. team could have explained the issues and resolution practically. also no design pattern or principle were used.
1,it only explains how they did but not why they did. the various approach could have been mentioned in the 
1,the authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. although they haven mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. they should have explained all the of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. one thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.
1,it is better to state the change of the feature or added feature with diagram to show the difference to state what remains the same and what is added or update understand certain circumstances.
1,functions are named properly.
1,the functions are not too long so the code does have to be extracted into separate methods. more comments could have been added for easy understanding of the code. the code follows the ruby style guide and the code looks statements unless keyword are written in single line.
1,the author work is implemented well and is implemented as expected. few edge cases can be written to test the code completely.
1,yes i was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall. but i could understand why there is need to append team name to an assignment. it was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well. mentioning that would have given me better idea.
1,the write up has been written well. there obviously some additions possible to the write up. the code changes additions have been shown i would recommend description of why those changes additions were made. i would also suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots.
1,the how part is clear. as to the why part thought they have clearly mentioned the the problem statement think little bit more of an explanation could go into why is that actually problem.
1,could not see test plan as well as automated test cases are not included team could work upon adding test cases to test the that would make the issue resolution more robust.
1,some checks fail in the build. but i feel that few checks are much intricate one failed because of score of. and can be neglected. the travis ci build error was faced by many teams too. the naming are not unclear or ambiguous. goto controller questionnaires goto controller review
1,the code is well written and very understandable newly defined function parameter name is self explanatory suggestion. rubric array can be declared outside the function so as to follow dry principle. meaningful comments can be included for the function definition in tree explaining what does the tree display represent
1,the code is nicely written more comments needed not dry in one place rubric array definition suggestion. simply define function to return the rubric array wherever required.
1,after manual testing issue seems to be fixed and reflects the changes properly. nothing seems to be done to fix issues and of the problem statement. suggestion. you can include any approach or design of functions to resolve remaining issues in the 
1,the fixes required part has been explained well with the cause of the issues. but more light could be shed on what the formative and summative rubrics are.
1, is written well. understandable and clean explanation. team has explained the problem statement and issues well with good amount of pictures. team can improve on formatting.
1,the was written well enough to understand. screenshots were also attached along with the steps making the documentation better. can definitely understand what project does and how it is done.
1,the is well written and contains all required information for issue. the documentation for other issues still needs to be included. apart from this the team did great work.
1,the is lucid enough to explain the details of the issue and how the system works after fixing it. suggestion. the authors can add section on testing explaining about how the issue fix can be tested. they can improve the readability by mentioning issue numbers from document issued by the prof. on the write up. it will save time of the reader to go through the document and map which issue has been fixed.
1, i could not see any test plan. team could work on writing test plan and implementing the same for the issues resolved. also where team is failing to implement some functionality as future scope they can try design the solution and also test cases for the same
1,what and how explained well but they explain the why behind their actions bit more.
1, is written well. no design principle or pattern involved but the approach taken is explained in detail step by step. team could add references and links.
1,the explains the problem statement well but fails to explain the approach and just have pasted their code. it also fails to have reasoning behind the approach they chose. suggestion. the author can describe how they came up with an approach starting from analyzing the issue. this will remarkably improve the . the author can talk about one more approach to fix the solution and explain why they chose particular approach for implementation.
1,as mentioned earlier they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence we are assuming that they are to implement testing at further point in the project. of course mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped.
1,the test plan is not part of the the team can improve upon this by following the general guidelines of writing the document. the test cases can be coherently designed following the better specs documentation. the team must have the test cases designed that span the required goals.
1,the variables methods and class names used do not justify the features performed and do not implement the desired functionality expected. also the code added does not improve the coverage of the files. the team should look towards using appropriate names and provide desired code segments to get high coverage.
1,the relating to questionnaire have been moved to questionnaire from which is very helpful. suggestion. you can try to create sub functions for code inside create and view as they are really long functions
1, functions are still long save choice and save are the top two consider increasing more internal methods
1,the code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build. the code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the ruby style guide. the team should focus on getting the tests running by following the dry principle.
1,the can be improved to begin with short description of the project background so that anyone reading the can understand what the project is all about.
1,unfortunately no mention of the word test plan has even taken place in their whole page. so it seems that they are yet to implement the testing in their project. although it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository.
1,the does not have the test plan section. they need to include it by specifying the section that describes the pre conditions considered by the team while working on the reactor review on the different question types from the feature.
1,the should be written in more elaborate way clearly stating at the minimum the problem statement new implementation strategy design principles test plan and references.
1,the states correctly the changes performed but fails to provide reasoning behind every change. suggestion you can include reasons behind choosing an approach for one code change
1,it was difficult at first to understand why they are doing what they are doing. i feel that the information is right there it just needs better elaboration and description.
1,not completely its lacking lot of informations consider writing the code before and after the changes to explain the changes done
1,the team needs to provide list of sections including the test plan and unit test cases that would make it easy to refer to the pull request and the code. they must also work on designing the page making it easy to read and understand it.
1,the gives high level overview of the work done suggestion. you can try to make the write up more illustrative by discussing which principles were implemented in which files and how does it make difference. you can take help of code snippets to make it more understandable.
1,good description. i think with the use of headings and subcategories it will look good also need lot of content to mention the changes done
1,the write up is pretty ambiguous and feels all cluttered up. maybe elaborating on few lines and separating the one whole paragraph into bullet points under different headings would have made it more readable and clear.
1,i could not see any mention of test cases in the or team could add mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge.
1,testing for the ui changes has not been done. maybe they were not supposed to but if they were more documentation in the would be helpful.
1,there is change in the colour code required so there was not much of naming convention to be followed here. dint find any instances in the attached code where name could be changed. one instance of is submitted could be changed to is submitted.
1,the naming looks fine in file. although your pull request shows changes in schema file which don think you have used any where or had to make changes int it. probably is went through by default when you pushed your changes. you might want to revert that from the pull request. that way i think your build will also pass.
1, the color combination could be changed for buttons. maybe for someone who has difficulty while differentiating colors me faces lot of problem.
1,code does follow the conventions. just that the comments could be better explained for the functionality
1,code is simple and written efficiently without long functions unnecessary looping or dead code. shown snippet itself is well and no need to be written as separate methods. code is well understandable. code does follow ruby style guide. code follows dry principle.
1,i could login to the deployed webster since there were no credentials which i could use. perhaps the page should have included the credentials for logging into the deployed webster however from the screenshots it seems that the functionality works.
1, the page is complete. only thing which i mentioned is good color combination is needed.
1, is written very neatly and in elaborated fashion with understandable images. team could have added link and pull request link at the bottom of the page. also references and credits.
1,the write up has not been formatted well most of it consists of what can already be read from the oss assignment specifications document. i would strongly suggest the team to include screenshots of their commits instead of using code formatting.
1,the write up is well documented. there is clear flow from the code change part to the screenshots of the implementation. it would have been better if there was screenshot of the code from git or link to git so that the code changes would have been more defined as per the green and red colour. also the code change could be explained more.
1,there is no separate test plan section but the test functionality has been shown in the form of screenshots. could add it under the testing header in the document so that the code and test would be 
1,project does not have test cases included hence can not check further if team is not able to add test cases for exact change team could add mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge.
1,team has used in style tags to add cos styling in pages. they instead need to create an external cos define the styling there and use the class names in tags. this provides styling throughout application.
1,the clearly explain why the team did the work that they did. good job on that. the only thing i may have to have as reviewer is detailed step by step instruction on how to view the changes made by the team in the app. this could be added in the or short could me made to help follow the steps.
1,yes the code change along with the screenshots does explain the ordeal but the git screenshots and some more explanation would be well appreciated.
1,the tests have been added as per the test plan but some of them have not seemed to have passed. the team could have look at the tests not passing and work on them.
1,code follows standards but variable names can be better and more readable. another suggestion declare all variables first then use those variables to call methods. when you add declare variables in between method calls it looks as though you forgot to declare earlier and added them later. just thought.
1,some names are ambiguous like i cannon know clearly what this name is for.
1,please extract all let to avoid the repeat code.
1,for each cases it include too many things need to be test it is better to separate them into different cases. also the object used for this test seems not be put into the factory it is better to make them into factory which is good practice. the use of context is not good enough.
1,including basic understanding of the problem statement and work will help in manual testing.
1,the functionality has been written well. though i do feel it would have been better if the test cases implemented had been explained in more detail as to what the do.
1,more details required regarding the functionality for which the test cases have been written.
1,yes the team has taken care of it by specially making section of what is the problem as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. they have even attached code snaps of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. although one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. more mentioning of details is required.
1,the has proper instructions but needs some improvements. explain the problem statement. explain why you need the solution. explain the steps you took. the code snippets are added but could be improved by adding explanation of the tests. may be adding lines can help.
1,there are not enough introductions about what the functionality of the class they will test and what it is used for. the team can introduce more about what is and what the role of the class will be test and its functions.
1, test plan documentation is missing currently. plan will help to relate with the code and understand if things are tested appropriately and the response is as expected or not
1,yes they surely have done good job in mentioning the errors in the doc. they have vaguely described the handling of the same but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. which means that better job and more technical description of how it is happening should be given so as to grasp better understanding for the same.
1,need bit of detailed explanation on why and how. too many screenshots with little explanation in words.
1,the motivation is not enough. it is little bit simple and general. the team should add the introduction to the specific motivation for this project.
1,the team has implemented automated tests. there could be some addition to the test which i have suggested above.
1,all the cases discussed in the test plan have been converted into automated tests.
1,the variables methods and class names are aptly named. i could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. the is well written and easy to read. ii it is adequately descriptive of the work done. iii explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.
1,the features work correctly as expected. the instructor login only has one student view tab under the manage menu. on clicking it the instructor is successfully redirected to the student view page which has the close student view button to redirect to the default view.
1,all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. no issues or problems were found with the functionality. the only issue is related to the ci built which is failing at the moment. the team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. other than that it was great team effort.
1, switch to student view but to which student. open and close student view is handled on clicking it to switch the type of view. same changes to delete session student view need to be done on layout in auth controller as well logged in as instructor clicked on open student view and logged out. when i login again as instructor i must still see open student view but i see close student view while i not in the student view at all since i just logged in..
1,yes the team has considered the two important and required test cases to check whether assignments is not present in the instructor view and check the presence of open student view button in the flout menu. here the team has also checked the precondition whether the user is viewing the correct page tree display list which is meant for the instructor. to check the presence of close student view button for the instructor to return back to the default view and have the assignment tab for students. suggestion the team could add line to check whether the system returns back to the instructor page after clicking the close student view button. maybe include expect have current path tree display list.
1,the clearly explains the implementation details and why those changes were made. it is nicely articulated and leaves no ambiguity.
1,the write up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. the details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. the team should include the same in the documentation as well.
1,the project is about adding tests to the model. so this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself. more details would be good for the uninitiated. also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient. it would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after.
1,the submission is about adding tests to the project and authors have done great job of adding code coverage. i would have liked to see more ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names. as of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not. how about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed. user class throws an exception or add method can. this could have been documented.
1,i would have liked to see more use of context in the tests and grouping of similar test methods in context.
1,could be better if contain with more info about the test itself instead of the rb file they tested.
1,since it is test rb file there are not many variable need to be named. the it part at line in the assignment team superb file get max num could be better if substitute with get maximum value or something like this max num seems little bit wired.
1, is very clearly explained. clearly explains how they are doing their work but why team is following approach is not explained.
1,the write up as well done. however the write up is missing the test plan.
1,the write includes the work done. however there is no explanation about why that
1,please add the test plan to the write up.
1,as mentioned earlier they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence we are assuming that they are to implement testing at further point in the project. of course mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped.
1,code appears to work. don really know what edge cases there could be due to lack of test plan.
1,although their documentation shows screenshots and their app is deployed on there was no testing plan how to test on application. there was no too. so it poses difficulty on how to see. but from the screenshots on the documentation the features seem to work good.
1,the documentation is good but is missing the test plan and instead of word document write it on so its easier to search and refer.
1,yes the team has taken care of it by specially making section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. they have even attached screenshots of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. although one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. more mentioning of details is required.
1,they have not created page but unloaded doc file which explains the work they have done adequately
1,the authors do great job of explaining how they did their work and but the why is sometimes not explained. that could be because it largely self explanatory.
1,yes they have explained why they did that way and it was clear. they have compared and contrasted in each of their feature of current implementation and solution which is better way of showing what they implemented one more suggestion would be it would have been good if they showed the difference in their code snippets too for the current implementation vs solution proposed.
1,unfortunately no mention of the word test plan has even taken place in their whole doc. so it seems that they are yet to implement the testing in their project. although it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository.
1,yes they surely have done good job in mentioning the errors in the st part and the second part. but it is unclear why the rd fix is problem or how they have combatted the rd fix in the first place. it just seems so that screen shot has been put into place and they displayed no method error they have vaguely described the handling of the same but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. in fact no code screenshots have been put up for this case.
1,although the write up has all the details about how the work has been done and what solutions are proposed. there are no explanation about design principles.
1,there were no and since they provided screenshot of the desired work. i suppose it the requirement
1,the code is readable and no function is too long. suggestion the impersonating as admin. and impersonating as ta. function uses the same session variable so you can try to declare it above these functions and reuse it to follow dry principle
1,the write up is good as i was able to understand the issue to be fixed and the implemented approach. i would like to suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots though.
1,the is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. the only scenario missing from the documentation is the scenario where the ta is assigned to instructor what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the ta of the constructor login to the application. apart from this the team did great work.
1,the clearly explains the issues and the approach used to achieve the desired results. suggestion the authors should try to include the spec test documentation for the newly fixed issues.
1,they wrote clear and adequate description and i can clearly understand what their project does.
1,the authors have included series of steps to perform the test and have provided screenshots but do not cover other possibilities.
1,the authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues in clean manner. although they haven mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. they have explained all the of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. one thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.
1,the does emphasize on how the issues are resolved however lacks reasoning as to why did they choose it. suggestion it is hard to follow the code as there is lack of comments. you can try to include meaningful comments for every function you have introduced. that will increase code readability
1,the write up is very well detailed with good information and pictures. two things. put the write up on the page instead of in word document. on the use the tag to insert code snippets into the page instead of screenshot of the code
1,all the test cases are passing however code coverage is low. various different scenarios must be tested thoroughly. travis ci build is passing and efforts were taken to work on this. appreciated.
1,a few tests were added though i like to see more tests regarding edge cases or invalid functionality.
1,the team has followed ruby coding standard. however function names could be for example the function get time diff btw due date and now name is just too long and can be modified into get time diff or any other meaningful name. also it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list so instead of using find participant the team can use find participant email list.
1,the write up is well formed and structured. the entire flow is explained along with files changed methods implemented in each stage. could have described the approach bit more.
1,code convention for mail looks good but i found find participant misleading because it gets email for all participants and not for participant
1,more comments are needed for clarity
1,the code has been implemented in modular fashion. however the team can improve the readability of the code in mail worker and assignment form. currently it lacks readability because of too long comments between every line of code and poor alignment which makes it difficult for user to understand.
1,at several places the code used lot of nested if else statements and some methods were very long. these lines could have been also more comments are needed that explain what method variable does just good naming is not enough. the code is dry compliant and follows style pattern well.
1,function length is good. general convention of having function length has been followed. what i found lacking was additional lines of comments before each new function to understand what has been implemented.
1,the authors work functions well but the code uses redundant bad logic in some places. code could have been put into methods and reused. the code functions as expected in almost all cases
1,yes features work as intended but i would like to see tests as well as testing case were job addition to queue fails. i understand this would be edge case and not likely to happen but still needs to be handled. other edge cases such as participant mails is nil have been taken care of.
1,the as well as design document has been created for the write up which explains the requirements. the team has explained the technical aspects in very detailed manner. however it would be helpful for users if the team could add more details about the functional aspects so that end user can test the impact on the existing functionality due to the changes done.
1,the team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented. it would have been more helpful to include the test cases in the write up as well.
1,existing tests have been modified to changed to pass for the new implementation. news tests could have been added
1,the team have explained why and how they did the work they did. feel they should elaborate more on the tests that they have implemented.
1,yes the authors explain the existing solution and explain the drawbacks for in them. i would have liked to see point wise comparison on how their solution overcomes the existing drawbacks. i would suggest not to hard code the mail text subject in the code and use config file instead. this will be easy to modify in future. i would have liked if the authors added why they took and not rabbit or celery
1,mostly looks good. can change names like this is enabled to is self review enabled and assignment form assignment num allowed to assignment form assignment num meta reviews allowed. should be single string.
1, maybe some more comments will be helpful.
1,the project has been explained in great detail. just feel instead of using issue numbers if the team had explained the issue in brief before elaborating on it that would have been great.
1, this whole is for you do not need to explain what it is in the introduction the snippet of code for issue is an intimidating wall of text consider adding some new lines or splitting it up some do not just but whole code file on the review if i want to read this i will find it on the repo.
1,they have explained every aspect of the project really well. plus the video also show the changes they have done. one thing you can add is audio in your videos telling what is being done so that its easy for the user to understand.
1,the test plan has covered various cases and completely explainable in simple terms small suggestion the first paragraph could have been itemized for easier understanding.
1,code looks good apart from lot of commented code. if that is written by the team and was not already present then it should be removed if not used before submitting pull requests.
1,the code has been modified to include the modifications requested test cases added for failing scenarios and edge cases two assignments with same name in my previous review. appreciated. overall the code quality is good. only some variable names are ambiguous for example check validate. what does it validate. name it like validate same name or validate common directory etc
1,there are commits on single day that is yesterday. one suggestion would be to commit regular progress on the git.
1,the code is well written but it can use comments to help explain what the code is doing. for e.g. the code below is hard to understand if assignment directory path and check validate on assignment directory path assignment name assignment id assignment course id end
1,i do feel the code can be deployed to the production server once few test cases have been implemented by the team.
1,the suggestions have not been improved. comments are explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do. it would be good to include meaningful comments. debut code is still in the commit. even though we may used debut code like the puts statement we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log. please consider removing them.
1,i don see any tests added by this team although they do mention that their code additions were not particularly testable except with the existing automatic tests which they enabled.
1, it fine to good. i wish all would have posted link to your repo in stead of the pull request.
1,some parts of the code are still left to be implemented
1,this system does have ui i can view as it seems to be browser add on.
1,the is quite comprehensive and gives the build steps clearly. it could also include more basic explanation in layman terms about what the api does
1,although the write up clearly explains the problem statement and also contains the changes made it does include the test plan which would give clearer picture of the changes added.
1, the authors have included the different tests that they wrote however description of what the test is testing would be helpful.
1,the document straight away starts with the explanation of the project specifics without any background as to what was the whole purpose of doing this. problem statement is very general it could have been more specific as to what was the drawbacks of the existing implementation and how that can be resolved with the new changes. the doc also lacks test plan. it is preferable for the doc to be written in rather than the normal .
1, is better than nothing but it still far cry from complete unit test suite for the review response map model. i recommend it be merged but it needs to be completed.
1,there is some repetition of code but overall code quality is ok. there are some comments from the professor which should have been addressed.
1,there were some issues which i reported regarding comments and notice messages displayed to user which needs to be improved. but they haven been incorporated. it is not blocker but definitely an important change to improve user experience and better code readability. for example in submitted content controller there is comment which says sending email to users. however it is just method call which redirect it to delayed mailer so this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone or understanding the code later.
1,the code is written really well. the professor frequently advised the team to improve the naming conventions as seen from the comments in the pull request. suggestions i still feel that the function review reminder email is bit longer.
1,no commits were found. the last commit was days back. suggestion i feel that there should have been some commits as the pull request shows merge issues. the travis ci build fails and the code climate is also not able to analyse the code. there should have been commits related to resolving these things.
1,team has added tests for assignment participant model which they have changed. as the requirement was just testing one component this is sufficient however testing the controller would have been more through integration test.
1,they should have added the code as part of the instead of providing links to commits.
1,the write up is clear concise and explains the work done properly. some screen shots would have been handy though
1,write up is really good. but little short. could have been described with more details. also it would have been better if they ha unloaded the of the work they had done.
1,the is written in very verbose manner. they still haven added the test plan which was missing. suggestion i feel that the test plan should have been added explicitly.
1,needs some work code climate changes bit of dryness and passing ci is needed.
1,i think user experience and code readability are as imp as producing working code. so based on how urgent is the requirement for this functionality i would prioritize the notices and display messages to more appropriately indicate what action was taken when we try to add participant to the assignment or import using file. secondly improving the comments as explained with an example in the first question.
1,the overall test coverage decreased by. you could have added test cases to response controller and application these files have contributed the most to the decrement in test coverage.
1,build issues to be fixed. this pull request is not in ready to merge state.
1,the pull request shows that the code has failed all the checks. therefore it should not be deployed. suggestions rectify the code climate travis build and the merge conflict that is being displayed on the pull request conflict. once done the code could be deployed. functionality is working fine no doubt but build must not be deployed unless the above issues are resolved
1,the travis ci build does not pass. suggestion team should have rectified this.
1,pull request failed the tests so that must be fixed before merging.
1,the team has added new test to cover the functionality. but this test is failing. there could be an issue with the notice that is generated as during run time it is set to nil and this is checked against the string provided in the test. the overall test coverage has decreased by.
1,as suggested by the team themselves few errors need to be rectified. the final code also needs to be formatted using to make it consistent with the design
1,there can be few changes incorporated to the code especially the name mismatch of the web ill and corresponding rust file needs to be fixed. the unnecessary comments have to be removed. moreover the pull request shows that there are few changes that have been requested and all checks have failed. so the code can be merged and deployed only after these are incorporated.
1,i think that they need to fix some things that are mentioned by travis ci. once they do that they are good to go.
1,the code is almost completed. only few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.
1,everything works as per the video linked in drive. a link to the same can be added on the page.
1,the is great. i could get all the info needed to understand the problem. could refine the describing issues section bit as i could see sentences like please take look at the issue for suggestions on how to solve this.
1,the team did not have in the last submission. in this submission they do have with the problem statement the files modified approach to solving the problems and test plan. this seems to be significant improvement from the last submission. as for the links i think one link is absent and the other one is video of the same project submitted last year. please check this i think you have added the wrong link. i would also suggest that references section needs to be added to the page so that the deployment pull request and other project reference links are shown.
1,it is very well written with nice flow diagram. the second video link on the page is unavailable which can be fixed removed in case it is legacy.
1,the team had not added link to the during round of the review. issues to be fixed section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing. please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed. otherwise the looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets.
1,the code can be deployed once the travis ci passes and there are some minor warnings to be fixed in code climate. there are failing and successful checks the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server.
1,this code is ready to be deployed if they ensure that variables are renamed to resemble their actual functionality. no big issues as such. resolves the problems well.
1,once the issues with pull request are fixed it can be merged.
1,unsure in this regard since they neither have the deployment neither the link to their repository and also the coverage and the travis ci say otherwise. even so in their video they show in proof that everything runs. one does wonder though how to test without actually having the links of the repo.
1,some improvements are required before deploying it to the main server. there are changes suggested by which need to be looked upon. the future team must ensure to pass the build. there is scope for the new tests to be written and code that would improve the overall coverage. overall the team has done commendable effort with respect to the difference in the first and second submission
1,i believe that code as it stands is not ready to be deployed. more comments are needed and the code is hard to understand so even though the changes are small one might need to see id the changes can be simplified. i believe testing can be more thorough too.
1,if they can write more test cases to test their code and make sure their code does not have bugs think they can deploy their code onto server.
1,no. the code needs to be cleaned up before it can be deployed. the build failure needs to be fixed. also as the project is not deployed manual testing could not be done.
1,the build fails and there are several issues and warnings that need to be fixed.
1,in the first round which files were related to what issue was not mentioned. however now they have edited the to reflect the mentioned changes. each file and its related functionality has been mentioned. appreciated.
1,there is no change in the code in this round. the variable names and method names are intuitive. the code is well indented some useful comments can be included to improve readability. the code is dry.
1,the team has implemented proper functions and has used proper naming convention. however there is scope to add some comments. for ex in the new method get feedback assessments for method which will return feedback assessment the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented. apart from this the code is concise and good coding and ruby practices have been followed
1,yes the team has added test cases the code for couple of test cases are in the in separate section. again it would have been better to explain the test cases little more may be using screenshots of successful test cases.
1,the code is structured well and is straightforward to follow. test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. the project has been greatly improved since the st round. naming and indentation issues have been fixed. furthermore significant work has been done for the code to be consistent with code climate. one suggestion would be to elaborate on the score method. decomposition could be used to extract the common set up into separate before each block and test expectations using multiple it statements as opposed to having everything asserted in one it block.
1,yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.
1,an unnecessary commit has been performed because of which build has failed and think it was required as already code had coverage. you should check that out it just an indentation issue think. format it using and push it should work. a shorter video to explain the work has been added as well.
1,i found many commits related to the code climate fixes. no suggestions.
1,works as intended. could have elaborated little more like guidance in was able to test the features. works fine.
1,the team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round review.
1,the authors have added the screenshots from which clearly shows the code change. but since there are many changes the explanation in the is small. a better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead. this would also reduce the size of the .
1,they should have included screenshots associated with the issue. it would help one understand the solution better
1,the write up lacks screenshots relevant images to explain the workflow of the project. this would increase the readability of the also the team has added and included description for the code presented in the these points were mentioned during the previous review which were picked up by the team. the team has done good work in improving their as compared to the previous version.
1,there has been some improvement in the content of the write up but not all suggestions have been incorporated. adding more screenshots of the functionality or video of the project being explained will always be helpful.
1,yes the test does covers of the models variations. the team could have enhanced tests with varied inputs such as for the handle method check. even more through test of the score method with different input data could have been done.
1,although i believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch i would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in travis ci. most likely it not because of their own code but as suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves and explicitly stated somewhere in the by getting clarification from the instructors.
1,i feel confident if the travis ci integration issues are addressed then it can be deployed in the production server.
1,as long as they fix indentation issues for code climate they are good to go.
1,the test is almost ready to be deployed onto the production server. as mentioned above there are some issues need to be fixed.
1,build is failing they should solve that issue then it is ready for production.
1,the code can definitely be deployed but once the pending code climate issues i believe the are to be resolved by he mentor and the travis ci build have been rectified. suggestion rectify the travis ci issues.
1,the project is ready to be merged. the source code is clearly structured and can be used for the future team to work on. the project has code coverage. in order to avoid potential problems of using instance object is defined in which is an instance of participant class. the possible suggestions are to deconstruct scores method and introduce context constructs to enhance code documentation.
1,it a test project so not applicable for production deployment. but the code can be merged as appropriate test for participant model. any future teams can enhance the test with varied input scenarios.
1,unfortunately the build failed in the second round. but in my opinion this was not due to the team mistake. the build failure says the two examples failed are in files assignment superb and assignment participant superb both files which the team had no connection with. i could be wrong though. as the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round i am inclined to believe it was because of another team incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake.
1,the pull request says the travis ci build is in progress but that seems improbable. upon closer investigation into the travis ci details it looks like the build is failing.
1,it is pending while i am doing this review. when i click on it it did not pass travis ci but it fails on tests on features while this group is testing participant it happened to our group as well i assume it is not an issue with their code.
1,the travis ci is in progress and there are issue to fix.
1,a commit has been performed days back which in making any change to the code just the indentation and since then build passed. you should check that out it just an indentation issue think. format it using and push it should work.
1,the travis ci build did not fail exactly but it did not pass either. it showed in progress. but when i clicked on the details it showed that the test failed. suggestion travis ci issue should have been rectified.
1,the code seems to be fine but due to lack of comments little hard to understand. it would have been better if there were some comments in get due date data and 
1,they haven made any change since round review. haven changed the naming as well eg topic id does seem right to me. but other than or names everything else looks clean. also you haven added comments to you code. you should add comments when working in open source project.
1,suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the nd round. variable names top topic deadline topic id puts statements are not removed topic id other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices.
1,no new tests were added and coverage has also reduced. some ui testing could ve been done.
1,they have mentioned that its ui change and has been discussed that testing in required in there documentation. but think you should still have mentioned something there. steps to follow to check how your changes work.
1,the write was good and well written. however it would have been better if some screenshots were also present in the may be juxtaposing the screenshots of before and after of fixing the issues. that would have made the write up easier to understand.
1,the is good and clearly explains the issues faced. however instead of putting in the code changed i feel it would be better to have screenshots of git commit history where we can see both the previous code and new code to get good idea of what actually was changed.
1,the write up is well written and organised. everything looks fine. the team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. also the team could have included few screen shots in the write up.
1, test plan is missing. code is directly copy pasted in the approach section pseudo code with proper comments would have been better. alignment is missing in those places where the code is copy pasted.
1,some improvements are required to deployed the code onto the production server. the code should included proper commenting so that if the future team picks up from this project they could know what exactly the code is doing.
1,it might be good to move the long function to smaller functions. but the code looks clean and understandable.
1,the build is still failing and there are issues which needs the team attention. there is one warning and error which needs to be fixed by the issue. according to the error team should remove the debut code from the pull request.
1,i essentially keeping my feedback the same. there are places where i believe that better names could be used and smaller methods could be used.
1,max choosers name was not changed. as far as understand it denotes the maximum number of slots and should be called max slots. which is not changed. apart from this code is good.
1,the team has done good manual testing but it would help to add few test in features to test the impact of the changes done in functionality of the project.
1,no new test cases were added. the new code changes don change the modify the existing code coverage. the modifications were mostly on ui. they could have added capybara testing.
1,the operation works perfectly from ui as shown in the the app was not deployed anywhere or the link was not posted so couldnt test it by myself. application could have been deployed during the second review for better understanding and trying out how the feature works.
1,the write up is well written. it looks like they have improved the test plan sections but still no automated tests in the repository.
1,write up is good and self explanatory. test plan helped lot in understanding how to test it. as discussed in the earlier review images could have been for better visibility. was little difficult when one had to scroll along the page to view the entire image.
1,the is well written with proper screenshots. i liked that the team has provided appropriate screenshots for specific scenarios which covers all the aspects of the project. however the test plan section could be improved by adding the test code
1, i think with proper testing this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server.
1,the code has passed the travis test and has addressed all the issues of the change request. the code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.
1,overall i think it could be deployed. there are no tests however written for this functionality and there are some ui patterns that should be re considered before deploying that do not match each other. when saving feedback the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is button per row while in the other location you must first make row editable.
1,the code seems to be working good from the my biggest concern was if the link to deployment was given it would have been easier to try the features. other than that capybara test cases could have made it strong to go to the production server. if they feature did work the way as it was shown in the it can be deployed to production.
1,the team has checked most of the points given in the problem statement. however proper testing should be done before deploying this project on the main server. it must be ensured that the overall coverage increases. other than the testing part everything else has been implemented as expected.
1,the build has passed. the are only syntactical issues due to version difference.
1,the build passes and there are only minor warnings and issues which can safely be ignored.
1,in documentation it mentions model file is changed to for increasing code coverage. however the file is missing in the pull request generated. there is no mention about changes in the assignment file. but that is present in the pull request. it may be name mismatch or some files are indeed missing. i pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently. the code overall looks good. proper variable names are used. commenting is required
1,the code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. this results in high readability. the team has made an extensive use of context constructs which further enhance the code documentation. moreover the team has improved theory by name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. this was complemented by the fix of bad names that were present in the first round e.g. stu etc. one suggestion pertaining to the scores block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value.
1,i do not see any new commit after th november. in my opinion some of the tests could be made more articulate in round.
1,the team has made two commits since the first review. the issues that were covered were scores block and mock instance handling. however the primary problem that the spec is testing an instance of class instead of participant was not addressed.
1,the coverage has increased from to which is impressive. however the previous issue was that scores method of participant was not called because the object that is being tested in this project is an instance of class. this problem was handled by commenting out the scores method of so that participant scores method will be called instead. this breaks other parts of the code which depend on scores implementation. the solution to this problem is to either define new participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself.
1,write up is good but the explanation of plan of work could have included some points like the approach taken.
1,the is excellent. very carefully written lot of detailed explanation. some more background information about the functions can be more helpful as well as syntax summation.
1,explains the testing functionality appropriately. as mentioned in review one technicalities are explained thoroughly but the functional knowledge required to understand what the test is doing and why it is doing what it does is missing. along with mentioning what are the mappings and return values proper explanation of what the test is written for will be more appropriate in document.
1,the is detailed but it does explain why code in the model had to be commented out very well. that was bit alarming.
1,the unit tests affording coverage is great but the code climate and other build problems are bit concerning. i think this could be pulled in with more attention from the developers.
1,if they had presented working deployment then rest everything was done. so it could be deployed onto the production server.
1,the project covers significant part of the functionality for testing the participant. however the biggest problem is that the scores method is commented out from the class obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality. furthermore the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant superb is an instance of as opposed to participant.
1,there were many lingering code climate issues and the danger bot and travis didn pass either. a little cleaning could be done.
1,the build did not pass travis ci. the reason is because scores method is commented out from the class.
1,yes the code already followed all the good conventions earlier except the lack of proper comments. the code still lacks comments and the author made any changes since the last review. but the overall code quality is upto the mark.
1,the code quality is good however it can be improved significantly. the code lacks proper comments and contains many if else statements. they could have been and avoided.
1,there are few issues regarding code repetition and extra white space especially in the controller spec file.
1,yes good number of tests added coverage increased but but would like to see more ve tests. mostly ve test cases are covered in the tests
1,the needs significant improvement. no clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. only file names are stated along with changes made. why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given. this review was given by me last time and no improvement has been made in this regard.
1,the write up is very detailed with comparisons between previous and new versions as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. it can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented why they chose this logic to implement the features.
1,documentation mentions the steps problem statement solutions and screenshots. the description are detailed. however i feel there is no need to give screenshots for tests written.
1,since the travis test has failed merging the code would not be good idea. the project does need to be redone from scratch some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.
1,yes the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. but since it didn pass travis ci this claims seems bit of concern. if we ignore the fact that lines of code was and thats why travis ci failed but still there are few lingering issues which the travis ci pointed which still been fixed. it seems more of patch which would require more patches to patch in the future.
1,this code will need to be however we will not need to build it from scratch. only some functionality has to be divided into chunks and moved into helper functions. the functionality works well.
1,no issues codeine can add test cases and after thorough testing it can be deployed. yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.
1,build fails that needs to be investigated once that is done dont see why the project cannon be merged with the mail branch. loot of good work has been done and merge with the main branch would bring the work to fruition.
1,the code has been merged in good way and there have been no merge conflicts. however the travis ci was failing and the code climate check was failing too. this is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing code.
1,travis ci did not pass. code climate also has issues to fix.
1,travis ci build is failing. lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. many of them are trivial and easy to fix.
1,the test cases covers the required test scenarios and the system operates as intended. the video file submitted though seems to crash. a link could have helped.
1,the team didn no provide the link for the deployment but according to the video they provided the features worked well.
1,the write up is very self explanatory. it successfully covers each and every aspect of the work done by the team and also to an extend what mindset they had while working the project which is very great. just one suggestion is that instead of simply dumping the files they could have made quick note of what the code in the file does. no one want to go through each and every line of code just to get an idea what it is meant to be.
1,overall the write up was not bad. here were some of the things i believe that could be improved problem statement seems to be wrong. i believe it should be included in the background as it merely describes the files that they are supposed to work on.
1,very impressed by one suggestion problem statement is not mentioned thoroughly however solution is very well with screenshots and code snippets.
1,the provides enough introductions for this project. according to the i can get clear insight about what the project is what the issues include in it why the team do things as the way they said and the tests they give to make sure the functions work properly. however the description for the first issue is not very clear and makes me confusing.
1,the code is almost perfect apart from the code complexity issues which in my view in very tough to fix. the project need not be done from scratch and it is certainly good starting place for future teams to pick up.
1,the feature implementation section is good to go. however the test cases can be improved on lot. that does mean that the test cases should be deployed.
1,the team gave fixtures for the issues exist but to make deployment it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly.
1,the code passes for the travis build as well as danger bot. however it fails for code climate with issues yet to be fixed. in totality the pull request does satisfy the need to pass the required builds.
1,the code is more about which is mentioned in the but i do not see any of the code in which changes are made. could have mentioned them in the for better clarity.
1,the last commit i see was days ago which seems that there went many changes done in the second round. the mentions the suggestions at the end so it would have been good to have the code changes and tests for the same.
1,the team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about the code. the code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the for future students.
1,the team has added tests and the coverage improved by small percentage. more tests can be added to further improve coverage
1,i feel that the project could cover more test cases which would have explained the functionality better. the sql that has been mentioned could have no results as well so covering negative results would have been better.
1,i found the write up to be same. there is more scope to improve it with more explanation and test cases specially the links to the codes could be added for the other teams to know.
1,the is clear and has illustrations to explain the flow. however none of the code is added to the documentation. the project also only defines the test added but could add more details about the increase in coverage
1,the authors should have added screenshots for the changes made in the code. otherwise the purpose and work done has been explained well.
1,the is good overall. but it would have been better if more code snippets were added along with explanation of why certain methods are obsolete.
1,yes i think with additional testing it can be deployed.
1,i feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in prod.
1,the code is written in modular way but there are some errors as shown by the ci. if these are fixed it can be merged with the main project
1,the code build passes the travis ci test and it has not conflicts with the base branch. however the team should resolve warnings.
1,the build seems to have passed but there are not many test cases listed to check the same. there is more scope of test cases in the same.
1,most of the tests passed. however small fraction of the tests have failed and the code needs to be modified to incorporate these changes
1,the code is well written. although as suggested earlier the team has not added comments to the code. in the page the team displays of how the code was before and after. but i still feel this is not adequate information for layman to be able to follow line by line what the code does. adding comments in the code for future projects would be my best suggestion. or as an alternative briefly explain in line or as to what the code does.
1,code written well. remove the unwanted methods there are few duplicate methods which can be removed.
1,the code was well written and no problem with long or bad names. but no comments were present. commenting would have made the code easier to understand. also was not done.
1,the code is really well written there are no bad names. the functions are also easy to understand. however i would suggest them to include more comments in the code so that it becomes clear for the person reading the code that what the function and changes are all bout.
1,could not see any commits after the last submission as were working fine but team could have worked upon improving test coverage.
1,no new code was committed in the second round. i would have really appreciated it if the team could have taken the time to add comments and fix some issues.
1,i see really less commits in the second round. the last commit was on st october. it would have been really nice if they have worked on the project further to enhance the work they have done.
1,team has added capybara test. but team could have worked upon improving test coverage. team can explain test description in test plan in step by step so as to understand what all test scenarios were covered.
1,the test cases added by the team pass. but overall coverage has decreased. i would suggest the team to have added more test cases for the new lines added in the controllers.
1,everything works from their ui. their peer review plan works as intended and clearly explains how to test on ui. there are sql errors when trying to delete user which is tied to some assignment. although the team has mentioned it is out of scope of the project future work could be to remove those sql error displayed on pages and give pop up alert box saying your user is tied to an assignment.
1, is written well and explained properly with good indentation content and screenshots. team could have explained test plan in more brief so as to understand number of test scenarios covered.
1,the write up is well organized but it would have been better if some screenshots were unloaded along with the steps. that would have made the document easier to understand.
1,the is short and precise has everything that is needed for testing and understanding and kept the small for better understanding. they have mentioned about their dry principle within changes itself. mentioning it as separate sub topic will give more visibility is what i felt. other than that everything is self explanatory.
1,the is well written. it covers almost all the work done. however one suggestion would be to include more details about hoe the tests were done. i just one small portion dedicated to explanation of spec and not the work implemented.
1,no it should go through more edge cases testing
1, the system and code these code changes seem ready to be deployed in production after heavy integration testing as issues seem to be working but pull request shows more fixes to work upon.
1,although as per functionality this code is ready to be merged and the team did put in fair amount of work into it. still i believe this project can be bettered by another team in the future by some the code to improve code writing principles and also improve the documentation.
1,after fixing the issues suggested by code climate the code can be deployed.
1,the code seems ready to be deployed as the features are working as intended but it would have been better if the code was 
1,the code can be readily merged into production. i felt code climate failing not an issue because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting different roles is the same functionality in the end. few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging. as suggested earlier removing the error for sql and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for future work.
1,the code is very well written as previously said. however some test cases are still not passing and that may be troublesome if deployed onto production server. it would be really nice opportunity for students in further classes take this up and improve the work so that they can complete the work which was left incomplete due to time constraints.
1,the build does not pass but only because of issues. the code written by the team in terms of logic is absolutely perfect. but certain conventions were not followed such as proper indentation was not followed dry principle violated. although these have no impact on the functionality these coding practices are industry convention and maybe the team would want to consider giving them equal importance for the next projects.
1,build is not passed. build failed travis ci. team can work to fix suggestion given on the pull request.
1,the build passed in travis ci and there were no conflicts. but some issues are not fixed like is not done and block has too many lines. these issues should be considered for well written code.
1,a better explanation on the test cases would have made sure that the code is ready. i feel that some more tests need to be done before deploying the code.
1,the code is functionally ready to be deployed in the production server because it is sound and even passes the build of travis ci. there are few minor issues due to cognitive complexity of names of methods lines of code and few indentation errors. if they are fixed the code is complete and will pass the build of as well. the team has proceeded in the correct approach and there is no need for the project to be redone from scratch using different approach.
1,from the file diff in it looks the code is in good shape. there were few suggestions provided during round review. if those could also be integrated it would be better. the test cases are successfully running. but the functionality could not be tested due to lack for steps in the 
1,the build seems to pass but it would have been great if the test cases were explained better. maybe some screenshots or video would have been easier to test.
1,code is very neat and readable. i appreciate you attention to following good syntax practices. there is some similar code was exists in the controller action method and the content page method but simple to bring out and make dry. overall great job.
1,the travis test had failed and shows indentation and other such minor errors. i think that the team just needs to work on the styling and following some ruby guidelines and they are good to go.
1,there is minor code climate error as mentioned above similar code. an easy fix and you will be green with the climate check.
1,overall the code looks good with most of the coding standards being followed. however i think it lacks proper commenting and also there were few stray pieces of commented out code lying around. adding few more comments and deleting unused code would be better.
1,there were not any bad naming in round as well. comments could have been added for new additions which is still missing. there has been no dry issues
1,yes the write up is good if they were able to host it have been better for checking the work.
1,it can be deployed but first it should be tested thoroughly.
1,as it did not pass the test it is not ready. for future team end of this project should be good starting place.
1,i believe this change that affects the system as whole needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure no other part of the system is brokenly opinion is that once all parts of the system test is done corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production.
1,few minor issues with the build which can be ignored.
1,the build has successfully passed the travis ci test and there are no merge conflicts present in the pull request. however there were few code climate issues which i think can be easily fixed.
1,there were only commits made during the second round. however the team had mostly implemented most of the functionality during the first round maybe due to which there are less commits in the second round
1,the write up is well written and organised. everything looks fine. the team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. also the screenshots could be little better.
1,the code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. the code need not be rewritten from scratch it just needs to include some more of the expected functionality
1,there is only error and warning which can be rectified and fixed and then can be deployed. no need to be redone from scratch. future team can fix it and merge to main branch.
1,there must be some test cases that should have been covered according to travis ci. also the build has failed. however the team claims that some of the tests are running locally. if some of these points are looked upon the code would be ready to be deployed on the main server.
1,the code looks fine. the only concern is related to the ci build which is failing at the moment. some of the tests are failing because of the change.
1,no build did not pass. checks very successful. it is liable and the issues are trivial.
1,the build in travis ci failed. out of the build jobs had passed. the build job failed in the features folder. the branch did not have any conflicts with the main branch
1,the code is well written according to the video. since there no submission i went to the submitter in the pull request to check his work. it seems that the code is relatively good. there some minor indentation and alignment issue. and not much explaining comments. but other than that no bad name no long function.
1,the code is difficult to understand. there are cases where factories are used and then later replaced by mocks in the individual test cases. the code also does not appear to be dry as several of the mocks appear redundant in the context of the plethora of factories built.
1,for each method there should be multiple test cases but they put all tests for method together wrap by single it... do they should consider to add more it... do to separate each test case so the reader know what are they testing.
1,yes the team made commits days ago but then it seems that they didn follow up with the feedback they received on the pull request as their were issues though of minor severity which required fixing and then there were no commits after that.
1,there no unload for the local folder. it seems that no new pull requests has been committed during the nd round so i would guess no new code being committed for the nd round.
1,the team did not attach the link for the repo along with the other files submitted. this makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made. however from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give full path coverage.
1,yes the team covered of the code they had to test. also the video given in the link was very informative and helped to understand the implications of the work done by the team to far greater extent.
1,from the pull request see coverage decreased but from the screen cast looks like covered when tried running manually get the below errors final versions from reviewer failure error prepare final review versions assignment maps undefined method prepare final review versions for class fab
1,the team did not add any test cases since they had achieved coverage in the first round itself. however certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the dry principle effectively throughout the model file.
1,the write up has some great information and snip its of code. it would have been great addition to have included more discussion on the overall design of your test cases. overall nice 
1,this is where the project lacks the mos. the write up in very informative specially for an outsider. it states the points very shortly without going into much depth. also the bombards the user with lots of un relevant information and pieces of code which make it feel very long although lacking significant content. the could have been more detailed and could have omitted the unnecessary parts like dumping of code and not explaining what it does.
1,the is bunch of codes there not enough explanation. the allow function is important for the mock functions. but it is explained in no place.
1,the write up is difficult to follow and does provide much insight into how the testing code works. despite having test plan section no test plan is included.
1,the team has worked on improving the document. the now includes the test plan section that was suggested in the first round specifying the how the team setup an environment the model functions used and the mock instance built for testing the model file.
1,yes apart from the issues of minor severity from the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project. no the project need not be planned and executed from scratch it is implemented well enough.
1,the code is good because it covers the scenarios. but one thing that prevents the star is that they do not have enough commenting and seems to be not that detailed and careful in terms of the explanation.
1,it is very difficult to recommend merging this code. although it builds and appears to function correctly it is not properly documented. it is difficult to tell how the code works and whether test cases introduced actually function as they intend.
1,it can be merged after fixing the code climate which has issues needs to follow the coding standards and need to work upon the overall decreased code coverage.
1,yes the code did pass travis ci successfully but as mentioned earlier the code did fail on grounds of low severity. this should have been fixed by the team as the issues were very small and required just minimal follow up.
1,great job with your pull request and passing the travis ci build. there are several code climate failures that could have been addressed many to deal with incorrect formatting and extra parenthesis or braces. simple fixes so great job.
1,the build of this project failed in travis ci. i checked the conflicts and the failures that caused the build to fail and they are assignment function creation page is able show tab due deadlines

1,travis build failing at. spec models menu superb
1,travis ci build indicates that the tests have failed. the code climate issues in the danger bot also did not pass. the team must look towards cleaning up the code.
1,the code is written very well. there some minor issues sometimes there duplicate allow s. but actually in the same describe just one allow is enough. on the other hand there no bad name no hard to understand functions. comments can be added just little bit more to help people understand. some comments are not supposed to be there such as discarded codes
1,the travis ci test did not pass. suggestion rectify the travis ci issue.
1,the source code is mostly written in coherent way and is straightforward to follow. the context blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation. the commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the st round are mostly removed. there are still few instances left and i would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability. i would also suggest to decompose the it block inside versions from reviewer by moving the common setup to before each block and spreading the assertions across several it statements. another improvement would be to remove the it code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code. adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job.
1,yes if must be they must need more test cases ot cover some edge cases.
1,the number of commits that are made after the st round is impressive. the team has made significant progress during the nd round however i would suggest using more descriptive names for the commits so that it becomes easier for the reader to refer to them in the future.
1,the command to run the test cases is given in the better thing would have been to provide the screenshots of the test cases and git links to the code to make the more concise and well explained.
1,the test coverage on the diff in this pull request is. is the threshold. this pull request will bring the total coverage in the repository to. change. seems like the coverage was reduced. need to add some test cases to increase the coverage. the above reason is why i have given. but i would definitely consider this as well overall coverage increased. to.
1,the team has created test cases for unit testing the model file menu the test cases are meaningful and are getting passed. once the capybara error quoted in the rd rubric gets fixed the current code can be merged into the repository. since the team project is unit testing and does not concern modification or augmentation of any feature there is no question of deployment to production server.
1,the team has improved the since the st round. the st round version consisted of the copied code from review response mark and review response map superb files. this version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for method discussion. however design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the . one thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. the team could provide rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.
1, i believe this code is ready to be merged once the travis ci passed.
1,once travis build passes the project could be merged. i have seen specs in the existing code base that are very implementation dependent so this won be an issue.
1,the team has worked on achieving the path coverage by taking the edge cases into consideration. but as most of the builds have failed it may need working deployment for it to being deployed on the server.
1,the build can be definitely deployed once the travis ci issue has been fixed. suggestion rectify the travis ci issue.
1,the should not include conclusion and learning outcomes part it is not report of the project but page to show what the project itself is.
1,the write up is good but it does feel much refined or improvised after the initial edit. as mentioned above the image in visible clearly which means that it was reviewed much after posting. but apart from that the flow of the write up is very effective in fact one of the best that i ve reviewed. the concept of giving higher level view and then diving deeper into the implementation is very subtly applied.
1,the write up starts with introduction about test driven development and unit testing. it then moves over to describing the problem statement team members test plan and implementation that contains detailed documentation on the procedure to set up the environment of menu model sample views declaration of mock objects as test entries and finally the conditions tested on each of the method of the node and menu class. the various methods tested on the node class include initiative setup site controller controller action content page and add child. similarly the methods tested on the menu class include initiative select get item get menu selected selected. and crumbs. the write up also includes the screenshot of the spec tests that were run. the screenshot of the simpleton coverage report is blurred and not readable. the write up ends with concluding remarks learning outcomes and references. overall the documentation was very precise and clear with all the information needed to understand the code on the authors could have included and highlighted how to run the spec code since their project specifically deals with unit testing. another apparent issue that i can point out is the quality of screenshot.
1, the overall is good but they did change the problem related to test plan like i mentioned last time.
1,most of them are good but some edge cases should be considered.
1,the given source code is ready for deployment. the object under test is fully covered and all of the test cases are implemented correctly. the build successfully passes travis ci. the future team will have no problems in picking up from here. however there is room for further improvement when it comes to simplifying several test cases especially versions from reviewer block. moreover it blocks need to be removed because the final version should not contain any tests that are in the pending state.
1,the function process seems to be bit long. it could have been splitter based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. apart from that rest of the code seems great.
1,the team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator which generates different wave forms like sine square sawtooth and triangle. they then created the file that generates objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples. the code in both these rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables. this made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of new programming language like rust rust is systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency. the variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented. one issue that i can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with lot of redundancy especially those that define the audio context destination node oscillator and few other local variables in the file are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file.
1,the team test plan includes running the oscillator binary file using the command. oscillator. this will run the where various oscillator nodes corresponding to sine square sawtooth and triangle waveforms are generated. hence the user will be able to listen to these waves after definite interval.
1,the starts off by introducing servo experimental high performance browser engine and rust which is systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build servo. it then moves over to web audio api for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing and workflow for implementing web audio was clearly listed. it then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation. the graphical and mathematical representation of the sine square sawtooth and triangle waveform gave solid conceptual foundation. the code snippet of the changes done in oscillator and the new file created by the team has also been included. the section build that explains the procedure to install dependencies rust step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project. the team had included the build instructions for windows and based they could have augmented the build instructions for mac os x which might save mac users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to single source the the authors end the by providing the test plan with examples of generated sine square sawtooth and triangle waveforms as audio files pull request and references.
1,i believe this code is ready to be deployed and if it in it can definitely be picked up in the future.
1,modify some to make it drier.
1,the code is almost perfect except for the lack of proper commenting. the author has not improved or updated the code since the last review as the last commit was about days back.
1,review comments were addressed. better name could have been used than ca test also scenarios test the code and not the behavior instead of when happens this method does this we have happens so contains this. this in maintainable as changes to implementation will break stale out these tests.
1,overall well written code. use of factory bot reduces code redundancy in building test cases. the team could have reduced the code redundancy inthe menu method test example.
1,the topic assigned to this team is unit testing on menu so they had to create spec tests for the methods in the model file menu in the new file spec models menu superb the team has precisely tested the of every method including all relevant scenarios as contexts of both the nested class node and the enclosing class menu. the names used for mock objects and are intuitive and follow the ruby convention. there were few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round. the team has rectified those in this round. in my view giving additional comments for code in spec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of describe context and it methods. the code is dry through the use of reusable mock objects like menu nodes site controllers content pages controller actions items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined. additionally the use of before each method to initiative and set up these objects further dry up the spec for the methods.
1,a few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.
1,the has covered nearly everything we need. all the function details are in the as well as each function. however i think there too much code and not enough textual explanation.
1,the code has been written as per the coding standard. the code written by the team adheres to dry principle. however as per my first review comments it is advisable to follow better naming conventions. the team could rename their function names such as the below one to something smaller such as get time diff. the code needs in names and addition of comments. def get time diff btw due date and now due date
1,the team has added test cases in the mail worker spec. more test cases could be added to fully test the functionality.
1,the code implementation is correct so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test the code would be production ready.
1,the git link to the code repository is not provided.
1,the code was well written and looks dry. however few comments could be added to make the code more understandable.
1,code looks okay changes suggested have not been implemented. i wanted to see more comments on why this is has been done which is missing. also strings checks for str. are still used and 
1,yes the team did add test cases but i am surprised on why the coverage numbers have fallen so much. this needs some investigation. i think good test cases were added as part of the work would have though liked to see more ve test cases checking for the failure conditions
1,was unable to test the work from ui but the implementation looks okay. i would have liked some screen hots of mails and videos to be unloaded as references so that reviewers could look at them as well.
1,the team added the test plan section but it was too short and did not explain all the test files created and or modified. the implementation section could do without the many code dumps. otherwise the was concise and effective.
1, the write up is comprehensive and clearly explained. should explain the test cases in more detail.
1,the write up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. it can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented why they chose this logic to implement the features.
1, is decent. i felt that code should have been quoted rather than included pictures of as that would make it easier to modify. the were same size which appears to be negative that people have commented on my work too.
1,write up is okay the test plan comes before solution approach section. pls change the ordering. there is no reference section instead of putting screen shots of code it would be better if the authors had put code snippets
1,a few changes to functions and their declaration have to be made to make the code production ready
1,no the build failure needs to be investigated. some regarding the messaging should be done. instead of hard coding the mail it should be read from config file.
1,the code is visually stunning. i am great fan of the readability there are some instances of redundancy in the controller action site controller tests. also in the get item get menu. would be easy to pull those out into begin block. otherwise very lovely.
1,currently your team have code climate issues that denote code redundancy as stated in the code comment above. best just to bring those statements out to keep it as dry as possible. from what i can tell none of the pull requests pass these requirements including my own teams so i am not sure what is the cause of this but i guess no one will be getting all the stars on this questions
1,the write up is good overall. i believe there could be more explanation or discussion into test cases not included in the design but otherwise good 
1,the test plan should have come before the implementation details. i gave this suggestion in my previous review as well. still the documentation is well written overall. it just puzzling choice to put the test plan near the end.
1,i had suggested changing the ambiguous or bad variable like temp temp. these changes have been incorporated. however comments missing. adding these will improve the readability of the code and make it easy to reactor at later stage as per requirements
1,the is pretty good. it gives the test plan and all the test cases. also there is explanation of the test process and logic. just one minor problem. the tests provide coverage of the lines in menu before the project the coverage was only it is an incomplete sentence.
1,the introduction to the scope of the project has been written neatly but i feel the test plan should have been little more elaborate short description of the tests would be nice to have.
1,while the test coverage has increased to the team has made some changes to schema file this might cause problem on other dependent modules. hence i feel it is risky to deploy it on production. the project does need to be started from scratch by the next team.
1,as its test project deployment to production may not be applicable. the code can be merged but would suggest few changes to dry the code as the test seems slow which is scope for improvement.
1,the code written is following the ruby on rails guidelines. the variables methods and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. in some cases they could have used little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app helpers student task they could have used background colour instead of run as variable name in the due date color method. it will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the also they have added to few commits for the amount of code change that they have done. the commit messages are not descriptive enough about what changes have the authors committed.
1,code snippet added. still git link is not of the pull request. no link provided for the change. either or the of the deployed application would have been ideal.
1,code is written very well comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. would just like to point out in student task due date color the variable run could ve been named better.
1,new code added is written well with dry and no long or complicated functions. i could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. team could work upon indentation.
1,there have been only two commits one on th oct and second on st october. there have been no commits since. it would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate since most of them are trivial.
1,no new commit has been added since the last submission. the commit messages are not descriptive. they should commit small portions of code one by one with proper description of the changes in the commit message. also their functions seem to be very long. they may consider and creating more cohesive code. each function should do only one task.
1,it is given in that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. however like i mentioned in my last review several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. this is especially true as add is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement write the required tests before implementing the methods in the above mentioned classes. add past due assignments to the student task list on student view. check for correction in due dates of assignments when an assignment due date is edited it should be appropriately moved from the past assignments list to the current assignments list if needed on student task page separate the list of teamed with students from the current tasks box.
1,the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. they seem to have considered lot of cases and have implemented them in spec the only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.
1,test plan could be described better.
1,team could have added test plan in along with test covered and test description. also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.
1,the operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.
1,yes it works as intended. it would be better if you could add video recording of the flow screenshots of the flow in the test plan.
1,the bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. they have provided step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. the authors haven hosted their version of the so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. they could have hosted on or they could have put screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.
1,detailed. but the screenshots of the manual testing are missing in the test plan.
1,the write up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. it can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented why they chose this logic to implement the features and how to test the code or show how they have tested the code.
1,the documentation has been updated. all the information has been documented in neat and logical manner. the write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. they havent updated any part of the documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.
1, the write up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. little formatting inconsistencies found like project in the introduction and only for overview but none of the other headings. looks like separate the list of teamed with students from the current tasks box needs to be heading rather than plain text. now we have created separate table for assignments sounds ambiguous does it mean new database table or table.. please be specific. a helper function was also added to format string into multiple lines please mention what the string is about what it represents what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into and why you would want to split them. test cases are not stated. test plan does mention one as for example but the testing process could ve been given little more respect.
1,i think the code need some amount of before it can be merged with the master and pushed to production. some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.
1,the code seems very well written and approach seems correct. if they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing it should be good to be deployed. as it stands another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.
1,the view file contain more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the structure of the view. it is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. and the commits contain the gentile which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment.
1,the code is written aptly and it does what it is supposed to do. however code comments are missing.
1,the code was well written and there was no issue with the naming or functions used. however few comments could be added to the current team new team and team to make the code more readable.
1,all coding principles are followed. add more comments.
1,the write up has most of the relevant information. the formatting could have been better. i would suggest the team to use standard dimension for the screenshots they have added.
1,i did not understand why is it necessary to prohibit spaces in i believe the code could have been modified to work with spaces as well
1,comments in the code would have been helpful to understand the flow.
1,the code was already well written. the team did great work in following coding best practices. the team should have include code comments to make the code easier to understand.
1,no additional commits were found considering one issue was still left to be implemented. suggestion there should have been some commits present pertaining to test cases or at least the rd issue that was not implemented.
1,the team did not add any test cases. the coverage did not increase as result of that. suggestion unit test cases should have been written as part of the final deliverable.
1,the project was not deployed. the project should have been deployed. however the video that the team unloaded shows the that they have implemented. and they work as intended. suggestion one feature was not implemented rd issue and should have been done as part of the deliverable. and the project should have been deployed.
1,it looks decent. the screenshots should be with the issue write up and not at the end
1,write up is written well and it is understandable. images are not in proportion and not of same size and hence page does not look steady. team can work on image size and image description and manual test plan in more detail.
1,the content is good and explanatory but the writing styles needs to be improved as there is inconsistency in the font size and font type.
1,the was well written and easy to understand. however it would have been better if some steps accompanied the screenshots as to what was happening in each screenshot. that would have made the even easier to understand.
1,the write up is well written and organised. everything looks fine. the team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand.
1,two issues resolved seem like working pretty well and can be deployed in production. third unresolved issue is good start for future team to pick up.
1,i think that the team has done great work for the future team to pick up. they can improve it by adding comments for newly defined functions. although the pull request build has not passed after fixing the conflicts the new team can readily work ahead on the remaining issues.
1,i do not think the code should be deployed. the test cases are not yet written and there are few code climate issues. due to the lack of test cases the travis ci build has also failed. suggestion once they are resolved the code can be deployed. there is one remaining issue but that could be done in the next iteration.
1,the ci build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. the team should have corrected the same.
1,the travis ci test did not past. i did not find any test cases written. suggestion test cases should have been written as part of the final deliverable.
1,the overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. i feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.
1,most of the updated code is well written. some functions could have been shortened. for example in the set display type function instead of writing when statement for each of the options you could have stored them in and set display type to that value if it exists in the .
1,the code is well written. it follows dry principle. it would have been better if more comments were added.
1,the team has made sure to write the relevant test cases wherever possible. but the overall coverage has decreased. in my opinion the newly added test cases cover more or less the entire range of this project. but i think that they need to focus bit more on the test 
1,the team has added screenshots on the submission page which show that the ui is working as intended. however it had been more clear had they made of the same.
1,the authors have portrayed their work by adding many code snippets. it is cumbersome to go through the entire code in the write up. a general approach towards principles used would have been impressive.
1,the code has been merged in good way and there have been no merge conflicts so far which is commendable. however the travis ci was failing and the code climate check was failing too. this is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing code.
1,the pull request still shows that the build fails. on observing the logs there is only one build job which fails due to error for view action method. this needs to be looked at.
1,even though the code has been keeping in mind the coding standards but i think that there is still room for improvement in writing the test cases and the pr checks should be checked as well since they are failing. this is something that the next team could pickup and then the code could be ready to be deployed on the production server.
1,the overall code quality is moderate. i would suggest the team to either use hexadecimal color codes or names to ensure that the code remains consistent.
1,it was simple ui color change so not many categories are not applicable. the code can be dry by using the cos file for styles. also there is no need to add colors in would suffice
1,no commit has been added since round. they should have fixed the build failure which is probably happening because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema which i don think is required for this project.
1,unfortunately no tests were added. it would have been good if the team added test cases to check their ui changes.
1,a huge improvement from round. in round one not much code was submitted so this is huge improvement. keep it up. i have suggestion it is very important to have comments in the code which will help other readers understand your code or in this case understand what you have tested without having to look for any other documentation which explains it. code file should be self sufficient
1,the structure of codes is not very good that is for it statement there are two many things include in it to be tested. it is better to separate the test cases clearly. besides the objects seem not store in factories properly.
1,the team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in more detailed manner. i do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project. but i do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the 
1,the description for the background motivation and the deign is not very clear. the team can give more detailed introduction specific to this project.
1,i do believe the code could be deployed after bit of is done as suggested by the code climate tests. but overall looking at only the functionality of the code it is ready to be deployed
1,it is testing project which aims at improving test coverage. so production deployment is not in question. however before merging the code to master branch here are few recommended changes. adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use. avoid using comments like i swear this is the last one. they do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why. proper professional comments are expected. all these comments should be 
1,the code has been merged in good way and there have been no merge conflicts. the build did pass the travis ci. the code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code.
1,the team has provided an excellent write up with proper explanation of the problem statement and the solutions they have provided. the team has also included video which make things really easy to understand. the team has shown navigation structure of the menu which makes the workflow clear.
1,the write up was nicely written in the first round itself. it gives clear idea of the project.
1,yes the changes work as expected in the ui. the test cases cover most of the scenarios. would have been good if there was some scope for negative test cases that could be explained.
1,the write up is short and to the point it could have been formatted and arranged in better way.
1,the write up was well explained. test cases were with images of test cases in the ui. the code could have screenshot or the link to the changed file for more clarity.
1,the code looks to be ready to be deployed on production but would appreciate to have few more tests run prior to it.
1,no. this is not standards to add colors in the respective element. it becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future. it would be better to move the style to file and use class ui to make this change which is clean and dry
1,build is failing probably because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema which i don think is required for this project.
1,i am honestly unsure how to rate this. earlier the build was passing. now travis ci cumulatively says the build failed but when you look at the build history job. failed but job. passed.
1,no. i see there are some code was commented which seems unnecessary so just delete it.
1,in the i really appreciated seeing the appropriate build statements next to the unit tests. it helped connect what each test was testing in my mind.
1,yes good write up but would have like to see details on model. in test plan lines like two test cases for method are redundant. can should remove them
1,most are good but the test cases part just combine of describe and it part of spec code. could be replaced by link of git.
1,the team has made great improvement as compared to the last submission. the new code added has no bad names long or complicated functions but there is lack of comments. the heading of the write up pages explains what the test case is doing but there should be proper commenting done in the code too.
1,write up includes everything the team has implemented. it clearly show the files which were involved to complete the project background of the project and everything overall work done by the team is good but i feel that the test plan on the write up page should be edited. the team should work on presenting their work to everyone in good way.
1,the code has been very well written and it follows all the coding practices. there could have been few more comments but other than that i don see any other problem.
1,overall the code is very well written and follows all the best coding practices. but what i feel is few more comments could help in improving the readability of the code. also there were few console debut statements which were causing the code climate checks to fails. these could be removed or logged into rails log.
1,the code changes are very less so not much to say about dry problems etc. the code has put statements which are also pointed out by the code climate put conditions is not good coding style the authors could have considered to remove the statements. puts hi im in import puts name the authors could have to see the flow of code or remove them before committing.
1,their is still the same doc file they had unloaded in the first submission. now while it was good progress in resolving some of their errors in their first submission clearly it is insufficient to be considered adequate for the second submission seeing as no changes have been made to it.
1,the write up is very well written and documented. it is aided well with the the help of screenshots and proper labelling. the only small thing that i would like to suggest is the steps to reproduce or something similar so that the person not familiar with the can also reach to the desired place.
1, clearly explains what their use cases are and what solution they came up with. there is lack of background about it how to test it from ui test plan test cases dry principle etc. their write up is not on which makes it difficult to download the file every time and check it. although it was pointed out during the first round the team didn change it or they didn update the page which they created.
1,again page is missing. they submitted doc for the same
1,while the functionality is present there are several debut statements in the code that need to be removed and tests need to be added.
1,not ready to be deployed. some changes needed along with addition of tests
1,these fixes appear to be acceptable. code climate could be better and debut code could be removed but if the changes in the document are in the source than i have no complaints.
1,no this code is not ready to be deployed since it fails in basic builds and just passes out of test cases which calls for reasonable concerns and in the motivation of the teams approach. however it does prove to be good starting point for future team to pick from where these people have left off.
1,i think the project looks pretty close to be merge ready and with small amount of work on the coding styles and making sure all the pr checks pass the code can be deployed on the production server. it might however require some rigorous testing before getting merged.
1,the code does its functionality but it not tested. my biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version. it is good starting place for future team to pick up and just cover the test cases.
1,nope they have errors in their build too as indicated by travis ci and this is the error message output by it hey something went wrong with the build. travis finished with status error which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests such as problem with dependency or the build process itself. on checking the build logs i found that they errors in bundle install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven resolved as part of second submission.
1,yeah the build has passed the travis ci test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request.
1,the travis ci has passed.
1, is still in the form of word doc instead of test plan and tests are missing.
1,the system works as intended however the flow for system given in the is quite confusing. the test cases were edited to cover all scenarios.
1,everything is working
1,yes the code seems well written and there was no issue with the naming or functions used. however few comments could be added to impersonating as admin.
1,yes the code is written really well.
1,the team has included thorough testing plan but i could find any commits to any of the spec testing controllers. they could have added as per there test plan. these tests could have been included login as instructor. add new assignment assignment instructor under the course course spring. make student as the participant of that assignment and layout using capybara and cucumber.
1,no there have been no new additions to the test cases since last round of review. the code coverage still remains the same as before with an increase of.
1,the write up was good and clearly explains the issues faced and the code changed. it would have been much more clear if screenshots of git file changed were posted.
1,the code is well written. the dummies created are given proper and relevant names. however i can not see much comments. i would suggest that inclusion of more comments would have enhanced the readability and efficiency of the project.
1,the is great but i believe it better to move the testing framework part to front of the page.
1,one test case failing on travis. once that is fixed code can be merged.
1,the pull request was not updated. in fact i can see any of the changes in the linked repo.
1,nope the last commit still shows from days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. overall the branch is commits ahead and commits behind the master. even so conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence no commits in the second submission.
1,no new commits after the first submission.
1,yes the code has been well written and very ruby like. the usage of existing gems is good. functions have were good. i did not find many issues with the first review. so authors have kept it the same. very well done. i wanted few more comment in code but thats okay.
1,test coverage has increased by very small margin. more tests would have been better. there are only tests. there are various other scenarios that could have been tested like missing or wrong attributes in request email.
1,yes the team added the test cases. new lines have been covered in the tests. good work. but i feel that they could have added additional ve test cases.
1,the features work as they are supposed to only problem is with the code using excessive if else like structure. code is brittle in this sense. could have made functions and passed parameters to make it more flexible.
1,authors have added new doc in addition to think that is not required they could have simply added that in the as in review would have liked a. link to the issue in problem statement. more details in why this was used and not other message queue
1,the code is ready to be deployed in my opinion to the production server. the team could improve the quality of their code by visiting the code climate tests.
1,yes build passed but there are many code climate warnings that can be easily cleaned up such as tips for and unassigned variables. a more careful look at the tool warnings was required.
1,the explains the problem statement well and proposes relevant solution. the team has done great job on stating the design approach and has included diagrams for them. however the team needs to add the testing plan for the project.
1,it seems you have all the needed sections and then some. you just need to rename them to project purpose project design and testing plan. for example the section titled testing should be renamed to testing plan.
1,testing plan is missing. overall looks good. can add snapshots. lists out all the the project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations.
1,the project describes the project requirement in detail. the project statement is clear. the team has also included the design flow which they will be following in order to achieve the desired results. the testing strategy is currently missing from the the team should include the test plan in the documentation.
1,it does list out all the functionality but there seem to be no solutions for them. an insight into the solutions to be implemented would be suggested.
1,changes are not currently elaborated upon. there is section labeled implementation that will house these details.
1,changes are not proposed to suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. i say this because even though they have detailed diagrams and solutions in place they have left important parts like tests and implementation empty. it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.
1,good explanation of the proposed changes. you may want to add it in separate heading. overall explanation quality is adequate.
1,as mentioned in the document some of the proposed changes are not dry which i would like to see improved if possible.
1,as for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be substantial since there is good amount of design aspect in their doc. sure they have defined an application flow but that is all there is to it. nothing about adding method to any class has been suggested. implementation section is left blank. the design been implemented to the depth to make it code let alone make it smelly. nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre existing gems for simplification. this too is hard to reach conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty. yes. absolutely much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.
1,though the author has not used diagram but the author has used other forms of pictorial representation to convey what he meant to say. but the team should definitely consider adding one or two the future.
1,design document explains the entire project flow very well. the whole implementation plan is very well written which clearly explains how the team is planing to work on project. the idea of including screenshots which explains how the functionality will look like once all the implementation is done is what i liked the most. suggestion team should include test plan in the doctor purpose of project should be explained more clearly. overall nice work.
1,there is good amount of diagrams technicality in terms of the section of workflow flow and models and thus we can say that it does slightly help get sense of putting things into perspective. none. both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended the diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. the diagrams are technically sound enough to define problem scenario.
1,could be better if you add the screens. only conventional flow of diagrams is present. adequate details.
1,the team have explained the flow of models using data flow diagram and have explained the use case using the use case diagrams. some more designs regarding the approach of implementation can be added in the documentation such as sequence diagrams class diagrams for new classes modified classes.
1,the document seems to be complete except the test plan. it would be better to include test plan in the document.
1,the authors have dine good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. diagrams like flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.
1, some more specific details could be added
1,the team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. overall quality of explanation is good. suggestion include the purpose of implementing these functions changes.
1,the explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like diagrams explanation of the use cases etc.
1,the authors have done pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. they have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. adding flow chart would make things much clearer.
1,i think their designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that can be simplified.
1,the design seems to be sound. i would like more details on the database of the projects seeing as most of us don know what they look like given that most of us have worked on projects. so short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand if there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non dry or smelly think the team is good on what gems are to be used.
1,screenshot explains the functionality of project very is really easier to understand how the end product will look like. suggestion the team should include flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality.
1,the whole document is easy to understand and well written. suggestion it would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.
1,good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach. include use case and activity flow diagrams also.
1,the doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. you might want to add test plan right away to go for test driven development.
1,the team has very well explained the goals and separation of concerns. the team could have proposed way to test the implementation.
1,the project goals are stated in simple and precise manner. the design document is readable and easy to understand from. they have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the they can include or add file names which they are about to change.
1,the authors have done great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution. i could easily understand the problem statement from the write up. well written. however the test plan is missing from the design document. suggestion you might want to add few success test cases and few edge test cases for removing reports.
1,the doc is complete except the test plan. a test plan would make it complete.
1,the design document coherently describes the project details including it purpose and design. this helps to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goals. however it could be improved by providing the test cases that have been carried out to get to the present state.
1,the team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such project. good effort. as it talks about few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped great deal in appreciating the project. the design selection is great. apt to the problem and the diagram to visualize it is helpful. the diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern as it was not easily to know if this pattern would fit the current code. test plan is missing.
1,the project design and project purpose parts are pretty detailed. however for the test part the authors only state that they will write tests for the new controller but no detailed test plan.
1,the authors have divided the design into sub tasks which shows that they are very clear about their approach. as per the problem statement the added functionality seems complete to me. suggestion you could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work.
1,the design incorporates the basic required that include the review mapping controller file to extrapolate it features to the reports controller file. it must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the reports from response report method to the controller file.
1,the authors have provided nice pictorial description of different strategies using diagram. the could add crc cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.
1, the authors have done good job by identifying the sub classes they plan to add. it would be good to have an overview of the class definitions. it is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.
1,the explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. though the need for the proposed ui change is not very clear to me. few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful. the explanation on the test controller is ambiguous.
1,the document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class 
1,it appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation which is good design. i think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add.
1,the design proposed by the team specifies an addition of new button to the buttons tray from the existing ui. the button when clicked must bring menu of additional reports. this functionality should consider the mapping to the review mapping controller file that will implement the given features.
1,the design seems pretty good. the only drawback is the test plan is missing.
1,the team has done good job with the diagram. however in my opinion it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.
1,the diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. it would have been better if it had also explained few attributes methods.
1, more or less an a for effort but i don know if the is fine with so little in it because we don care about what those classes do or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors.
1,the teams implementation of diagram seems to be good way of representing the changes diagram could have been detailed with regards to the classes that are being added and modified. there should be attributes of each class then the methods that are added or changed with the type of inputs to these methods and return types of these methods.
1,the authors have made it clear by including mock up screen of the proposed solution. they have used class diagram for the newly identified sub classes and hence i think that they have made adequate use of visual aids. suggestion they can add use cases for the new feature.
1,the diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods
1, the diagram provided is generalization for strategy pattern and more aligned to help give simpler outlook the standards are not followed as it should indicate the class type as an interface and the method implementations needed in the concrete classes the is high level indication. more project specific diagram is needed
1,a brief description for the class level implementation would be better.
1,the document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature however i would suggest them to include how will they implement it. there is no explanation of how things will be done.
1,search questionnaire and search reviews don have detailed explanation of what should be done.
1,the explanations seem very clear. although splitting the er diagram into or more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.
1,it could be better if you tell in which files you ll be making those changes and if you ll create new functions or make change in existing functions.
1,team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. could have given more detail on design using diagrams and files involved in the project
1,the changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. they have defined the changes extensively. however the search for reviews section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. the authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used little more elaborately.
1, is missing but er diagram is given. you can add diagram it explains things better.
1,they have depicted their working strategy through an er diagram. however i would suggest them to include more diagrams to enhance understandability also the er diagram is somewhat incomplete.
1,i feel the diagram is more complex team could have gone with some unease crc diagrams
1,just one er diagram. add use case and activity flow diagrams.
1,there is an er diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar etc.
1,they have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. they have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete
1,write up clearly explains the project purpose what changes needs to be made however including mock test plan would have been better.
1,most of parts are included but they should include more details in their doc.
1,the team has well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualization and files to be changed. they could have written there testing plan in more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what will be tested. the could have also added some use cases.
1,the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the the contains mock visualization which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. the design flow as flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. the test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. suggestion the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for particular part of code. for ed we plan to have dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualization correctly if the sum id being counted to of the class participation etc.. the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.
1,the document shows the flow of work really i would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. this will enhance the quality of the document to great extent.
1,the design doc is good and provides clear picture about the objective of the project. however it would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.
1,the documentation covered almost everything from project purpose design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project. suggestion i feel that the test plan was bit vague. some more details should have been provided. for example what all features will be tested. or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered.
1,the design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance but not much is included for integration of review performance. suggestion the topic of integration of review performance can be talked about in brief.
1,yes the design incorporated all functionality required. but more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.
1,the design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing bar graph solution for the select criteria. it could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. the flow in general does help to understand the project.
1,the explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. adding of screenshots of the flow of the webster would make it more easy to understand for layman
1,the overall quality of the explanations are good but they should include more details about their design which may not be easy to understand.
1,the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. the team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. the team could also use crc cards to depict the proposed code changes. this will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.
1,more explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. while its early in the project at least what changes will be made to file could have been mentioned.
1,proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how
1,the changes proposed by the team include implementing bar chart stacked or single. based upon the project description it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with minimal look.
1,the proposed solution sounds good. they haven really mentioned the changes in turn of programmer language. i could visualize how are they going to make changes. they have mentioned few file but i think they would need put good amount of work to implement the new feature. i think the team could have been more precise in their approach for example they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.
1,so far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right not much research is done so far. i would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.
1,the team has given design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. it can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.
1,the design looks good enough. it mostly deals with files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. suggestion if the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. i did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. that too would have been useful.
1,the have included detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualization the could have added lo fi ui cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.
1,one flow chart and one chart graph are included. i find the chart incomplete and confusing too. i was able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. the better way would be to use use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.
1,the team has attached bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. suggestion more visual aids could have been added. the stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier. more could have been added.
1,the design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have few screenshots of the current view.
1,a flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation. suggestions i feel that there should have been of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. team should have shown how the solution would look like on the page. there could have been use case diagrams too.
1,two graphs provided provide good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. more diagrams would have been helpful.
1,all good components of design document are present. it would be nice to have the ui without handwriting that may make it hard to read.
1,all the components are present in the however more effort could have been made to make sure the formatting and overall structure follows pattern. some of the elements are haphazard and could have been redone. ui are not clear. good effort though.
1,the document is well written just that diagram or something similar could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand.
1,good work on problem statement and implementation ideas. however screenshots could have added. loft sketches and flowcharts missing.
1,this is one area where the authors could have improved. even though there is good amount of textual description and images the authors could have added snapshot of the code changes that they wanted to propose. this would make it clear as to the exact changes that you propose and further help answer this question.
1,would be good to include high level overview of changes made in the files.
1,the author has mentioned which files have to be changed but no mention has been made of how they are going to be changed. could have expanded bit more on that aspect
1,the problem statement could have been elaborated bit more. one line does seem enough here.
1,could have added diagrams loft sketches and flowcharts.
1,no diagrams present can create simple use case diagram to indicate the flow of the solution
1,as mentioned previously the ui are decent but don necessarily convey the overall design concept to those not familiar with the system.
1,they used ui to explain their implementation. though some diagrams like use case would be preferred over this.
1,there were few hand made diagrams posted however i feel used of some other high level diagrams and screenshots would have been better.
1,the hand drawn diagrams are good enough to explain the problem to others next time they can update it with the actual page once its done.
1,the project design and the testing plans are well laid out. solution part does not have any description in it says it will be given in the detailed design. could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram.
1,the project is not complete at this moment as there are lot of things missing. like what the team plan to do and what concrete are its testing techniques. it only mentions the problem statement and an overview of testing.
1,only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution. please add design and diagrams.
1,the project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. even so in their project they lack two sections of key note i.e. one is the project design and the solution approach.
1, diagrams and the solution proposed by the authors to solve the issues is missing.
1,the doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise plan to tackle the issues identified.
1,team have decided to give all details after final submission. a design doc should be available before starting the project. i would recommend to provide few details on project design classes involved in the project or application flow etc
1,the project purpose is explained with examples but no design or plan to implement is given. again under the test plan section generic method is given but is not specific to the project.
1,the design doc for now specifies only the issues. no approach has been given yet on prospective solutions.
1,please add more details about the solution.
1,the design document has mentioned the issues which need to be fixed but why these issues are occurring and what will the solution be is missing.
1,yes the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
1,have covered almost all the issues it would have been better if an implementation plan was provided.
1,the author mentioned any prospective changes. so this could be looked in to.
1,there are no solutions proposed. just the issues are listed and explained. a possible screenshot or flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution.
1,no implementation proposed in the design document only need more detail for it.
1,changes are not proposed to suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution. they have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution.
1,there were no such solutions listed on the basis of which i could suggest some better solutions. a couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.
1,the author has not written any plans about the implementation. it only states the problem statement. the author needs to do more work in the 
1,as for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be redundant check since there is minimal amount of design aspect in their doc. they haven even defined an application flow. nothing about adding method to any class has been suggested. as per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design. the design been implemented to the depth to make it code let alone make it smelly. nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre existing gems for simplification. this too is hard to reach conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty. yes. absolutely much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.
1,there are no diagrams present. it would have been great if screenshot of test case or flow diagram was given.
1,could have added more explanation on the changes proposed by the team.
1,the project purpose. design and test plan are all explicit and detailed. just one suggestion that the structure can be more centralized. for example the. and. may better be together like overview and details which i think may be more specific.
1,i felt there was need of adding more explanation. add diagram so that it is easily understood
1,the explanation is good the images are very large on the screen and it is hard to spot the changes that you made consider highlighting the changes to show them better.
1,the authors have considered the requirements and accordingly designed their solutions. the proposed ui design looks very intuitive and the abstract understanding of the code seems to good. however the implementation is required to say definitely if it makes the code smelly
1,the team has not mentioned what method they are planning to change inside the controller.
1,the test plan seems little vague. maybe the scenarios can be explained in better way first and then given in bullets.
1,there are ample screenshots of the ui to help the user understand the flow of the changes made. however there are any diagrams that explain the use cases and the design of the newly added 
1,need to include diagrams try include use case diagram to explain the flow of the solution and class diagram to explain how you will be implementing the solution.
1,there could be more visual aids to help reviewers get better understanding of this project.
1,only screenshots of current web page may need some diagram to show the design in the future.
1,the team has provided screenshots to help understand the changes in the ui that need to be reflected. moreover the team has included proper steps in which every task is achieved.
1,the team have done good job explaining their project. but i feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. also more test cases should have been included in more detail.
1,all parts are presented but need little fore explanation in test plan part.
1,the document clearly specifies the problem statement. it seems good enough. they have mentioned the api they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. however i would like more details on this api and how they plan to integrate it into their project.
1,the document is almost complete. includes proper planning and demonstration. only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done.
1,i think technical design lacks details. the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work where will the string be kept. what are the effective changes required across the project test plan should have more tests
1,the design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. the doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed. suggestion i feel like the test plan should have been bit more elaborate. the team did mention one scenario. i feel like there could have been many more. but as all the required things are present i am giving this post full stars.
1,the design encompasses all the features in the specification. it only indicates supporting one more language though whereas the design document specifies any language. it seems out of the scope of the project but what if you used the cloud translation api to translate the static strings at run time. then you could support almost any language. there might be licensing issues though.
1,the explanations are done well but they could be more thorough. why is the internationalization api and translate needed. also will you use script to edit the views. how would you do that. it seems like too much work to do manually.
1,need to edit test plan and add more test cases.
1,the explanations given are succinct and clear. the flow of implementation seems very clear. however as mentioned before i would like more details on the api
1,the changes proposed are quite understandable. however i would suggest them to clearly provide clear path how they are going to reach their result. the initial planning is quite appreciable though.
1,i do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. the team also has mentioned about the api that they will use. enough efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. suggestions no information about the methods that will be implemented has been given in the design document. availability of such info would have been helpful.
1,the screen were very nice. good job. i would like to see diagram for the implementation i.e. how reference to static string in view eventually maps to the correct file. that would make the design more specific and clear.
1,there are mock ups of the end result. but there are no other diagrams. there should have been some diagrams to help explain their design better as well as the flow of the implementation.
1,the only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page. more based diagrams could increase understandability
1,no diagrams present. suggestions although the make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like the team could have mentioned use case diagram or flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality.
1,it is extremely detailed. eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on code snippets as and when they happen.
1,the design document is comprehensive and detailed. however there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. the document misses out on mention which model controller they will be making changes to.
1,the document is well written. they have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. they also gems that can be used and api to query if gems were not allowed. they have section called the testing plan however that does look like traditional testing plan. it just shows the navigation path that different users would take.
1,i think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics but not how all the metrics will be incorporated in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these total number of commits. number of files changed. lines of code added lines of code modified. lines of code deleted. loss that survived until final submission exclude from map due to the complexity and lower priority.
1,get the pull metrics and show em to person. that person being an instructor.
1,the explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. could not have been any better. a sample request response of metric api would ve made it more amazing.
1,the authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. i would suggest the team to consider new controller since adding new code to an existing controller may not be oo design.
1,very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. it would have been great if the team had added db design as well but the work done is sufficient.
1,the explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.
1,they have listed various possibilities to get the task done. the use case and diagrams also help here. suggestion please add the places where you want to make have made the changes.
1,the authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they be adding the associated code.
1,the design is well explained. need clarification on below how will this metrics will be used to grade the student. so how will the final marks for particular be calculated using the data from .
1,the design seems to be good. it is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven advanced to the implementation stage yet. the authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. i think they should go ahead and use the gems.
1,proper use case diagram have been added. for next submission team can add diagrams.
1,the team have done good job explaining their problem statement and implementation. but the documentation does not include the testing plan. the team should write about the tests they plan to implement.
1, your background and detail of description is excellent. however without strong background in the topic i could not figure out what dom was. i don see anything about test plan but other wise the detail was good.
1,the problem statement and what needs to be done correctly explained.
1,no test plan but the project purpose and design are decently well explored especially if you look at the link to the first project page. i recommend pulling forward the diagrams and explanation to save your readers the effort of looking in another place.
1,the documentation states the purpose of the project as implementing api for the servo browser engine under the problem statement. it also includes the proposed design that specifies the flow of the project and the files that are interlinked. the testing plan has not been included in the current version of documentation. i expect that the team is working on it and will include it for the nd round after they start the implementation.
1,it would be better if testing plan is included.
1,the document covers number of important topics including the description of servo apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project problem statement project build and proposed design. however the testing plan is not discussed. while the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document e.g. specific could be tested by writing custom file and then running it the similar way. and finally we ll test our code by enabling the blob api. the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested. i would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which provide an overview of servo project off screen canvas web workers and web ill they introduce more verbosity to the document than necessary. two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead. the reader could refer to more detailed information through references. furthermore the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the api making it somewhat redundant. it would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary. another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the changes that are going to be merged in servo.
1,from my previous review of this project there have been few additions to the set of implemented. for the rd project oss the team had worked on interacts with and d.rs works on which are implementations of .webill and web idl files respectively. in this project the team has proposed to implement analogous to d by refusing some code from the latter and add additional . they finally propose to implement blob api to test the contents on the canvas and also support well contexts as used in 
1,the design incorporated all of the functionality required.
1,the design document covers high level view of the required functionality. the concepts and motivations behind d are extensively discussed. moreover the document provides the files that are going to be changed by the team. the main problem of this design is that there is no detailed explanation or examples of what the final expectations are. i would suggest giving more specific examples of how the proposed api should work and what may be the main challenges of the implementation.
1,the document needs more details on the implementation of the d the support for well contexts and the blob api. also what is dom and blob. those terms should be defined in the design document in case any readers are unfamiliar with them.
1, i don know much about the topic and so it can be hard for me to judge but i would have liked couple more pictures or other aids to understanding
1,you can mention that what are you going to do to achieve your goal. like it is mentioned that as part of the third project we ve already done with the implementation of interface so how are you going to achieve the next implementation.
1,the design plan portion feels bit lacking. i found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next. what going to be filtered out. what going to be added. i have no clue..
1,nearly perfect
1,the new design seems to violate the dry principle. copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code. this is probably still better design decision than writing the canvas from scratch however since it will take less time. could you use delegation or extension to dry out the implementation.
1,their design is pretty well but some part of that are not very detailed.
1,as stated on previous comment the design needs more explanation.
1, the that the authors plan to add seem logical as they plan to implement as an efficient alternative to but with all the included. the authors have not discussed about the implementation of the proposed design yet which i am expecting them to do in the next review. the response time is expected to decrease with the incorporation of because the rendering of the images in the canvas is done independently using web workers
1,the document should expand on the design and make specific assertions about how the changes will be propagated. so far the idea behind the design is to utilize an existing code of d adding new functionality like blob api on top of that. one suggestion would be to elaborate on that and discuss how the new functionality will be merged with existing code what patterns might be used to increase the efficacy and simplicity of the system.
1,the author did not add methods to wrong class.
1,no visual aids are present. though the team have explained their work pretty well the team should think about adding few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project.
1,some more visual aids would better help the reviewers understand how the canvas context would be different to the existing environment.
1,try to include use case diagram to indicate your flow and class diagram of how you ll be implementing the solution.
1,there are no visual aids on that page but there are some on the previous page. some more would definitely be welcome and should be placed on the final project page.
1,the authors have not included any visual aid in this document. the page of their previous project documentation has flow chart that has the code flow that shows how the control flows from higher level interface the specifications in the to lower level physical through the intermediate implementation of on rust and dom.
1,it would be better to incorporate some visual aids in the design doc.
1,unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. i would suggest providing the simplified diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.
1,the project purpose seems to be only user story that says what the deficiencies of te current issues and terse solution. i wonder if that comprehensive enough. i would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed in lower level. there only high level solution and which files to change for the project design. they are not detailed enough. i would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change when to do the change if the changes are inter dependent. there no testing plans yet. but i think that should be stated.
1,the document mentions the problem statement and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it. there is no reference to code or functions that might need some modification. some design talk would be nice.
1,the design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. there are no sections for project purpose project design or project testing. consider adding these sections to give order to the document. also red front against white background can be an eye strain for some.
1,the testing plan is not proper. though the document is nicely presented it does not concentrate on all areas. i would suggest to systematically describe each step.
1,the document lists all the problem and possible solutions which is good. however there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions for example you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the files need to be changed. also the testing plan should be added.
1,changes proposed are adequate but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. it is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls
1, more effort should be expended on the design. the solution is too high end abstract. also some screenshots being added would be lot more helpful. and addressing the above issues will also increase the readability
1,proposed solution is correct but as have said in other comments there should be design present.
1,there is an assign grade link for everyone but only perform review for certain teams. but why does perform review appear for everyone. or at least update review. not if review has been submitted at least until the next round starts. this was confusing. do something that clearer. sol the feature as understood from the past project is that assign grade is present for all teams. standardize the functionality case no review performed yet perform review button case review started view review button edit review button case review submitted deadline not crossed view review button case review submitted deadline crossed update review button lets always have view review button once review has started change the update review name to edit only available for instructors and ta itself that should be clear hope. we will make changes in list comments case and buttons should be switched. if the deadline has been crossed you should have the option to view the review. otherwise you should be able to edit the review.
1,the design seems pretty good but the solutions are little bit unspecific. it would be better if there are more explanations about how to implement the solutions so that the reviews can give you more feedback.
1,the write up is very minimal. i think it should elaborate made
1,the project purpose is stated in detail in the introduction part. starting from the background and problem statement to improve the quality of report views. the purpose is stated in five different small goals separately make changes in view submissions view scores view review report author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. in terms of project purpose it comprehensive and detailed. as for project design it is carefully outlined in the solution and modification of files part. i think the project design might needs bit more description in terms of what steps needs to do first and what steps needs to be done next. it seems that all the changes are for the ui but is there any ui that can be served as pattern for the usage of others. or is there any implementation of one ui dependent on the implementation of another. here i think there needs to be more detailed steps. the testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as end user. i like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. it will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available.
1,it says what they will do but it seems high level. would appreciate some diagrams or 
1,the team has done good job in listing down the project requirements and design. however i suggest the testing plan be improved. in place of giving steps on how reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added for example list down dummy set of data in any one report view mention how they would like to write test for this. say using capybara and then how to corroborate the result from the view.
1,the doc seems complete. all aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. a use case diagram will be useful to add.
1,the authors can add the project purpose why this feature is important helpful. the authors have mentioned the plan to use query to sort the table but no design plan is included. i suggest the team to remove the introduction to since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.
1,the design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the that need to be performed. however it looks bit incomplete to me. suggestions try adding what were your proposed approaches and clear reasoning as to why did you choose particular approach. you can simply remove the statement on as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it.
1,the design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. general problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific which will be addressed by the project. the solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. this is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. the primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. it is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. i would suggest elaborating on the specifics what functions are called and how will the function be tied to the table contents.
1,the team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. the test plan is adequate. it would be better to provide solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. few sorting implementations ie by name and team are intuitive. but the need to sort the author feedback report and teammate review report in the way suggested by the team the reasoning is not very apparent. need more problem statement elaboration.
1,the document mentions the tools of query sorting table in fact which api or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. also this project seems to focus on the view part of so the test plan should be more detailed cover more edge case.
1,though the pull request has been passed but the does not explain the details of the implementation like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using query etc. the design part of the is very hollow and needs further refinement.
1,yes all the including viewing submission viewing scores viewing review report author feedback report teammate review report are all available. i believe more intuitive detailed explanation or description might be even more useful while describing the in the design. here such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.
1,please add more details about the solution. how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
1,yes as per the solution provided it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. it considers sorting on all the specified fields. suggestions since you have mentioned the use of query you may also add explanation as to what is r and try explaining for one field e.g. name as to how does it work to sort the entries.
1, yes their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. but how the team will achieve the few not so straight forward sorting such as the one indicated in author feedback report is not clear to conclude their approach will achieve the intended functionality
1,the provided by the author are at very high level view and needs further drilling down into the implementation.
1,the changes being proposed including the modification of files submission team title view review report feedback report and teammate review report. i think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. but more details needs to be stated how should we change this list file. should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern. in which file will the sorting be implemented. there does have information on how to sort by query but there not yet information in terms of which file which part needs to be changed.
1,the proposed changes section of the clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. but how they want to implement the sort could be explained little more in detail. they mention they would use query but i would suggest to add some sort of that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.
1,the explanations can be more detailed. overall understandable.
1,the authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. it seems that they have already done some changes. suggestions i feel that the proposed changes on high level. you might want to go level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. you might also consider adding use case for your changes.
1,the authors provide list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and high level overview of what needs to be done. the rationale behind using query library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution.
1,it states the internal query library they plan to use to achieve the sorting again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution.
1,need some diagram or prototype.
1,i believe more effort should be expended on the design. currently it is still not so comprehensive. a lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.
1,the design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. since this project is only to sort the views there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. i hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.
1,i think that the authors have identified changes in the files which looks right to me. as it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports the changes must go in the views part of the application. suggestion you can try to add bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code deletion of existing code or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. query do you plan on creating drop down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed. if yes it is an add on user friendly feature.
1,the authors talk about adding the class to the table and using scripts for further action. there are no apparent problems with this strategy however i would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. for example it is not possible to understand what the part will look like how many functions will be used or how they will interact with .
1, the team has already identified the files to be changed which is good thing. it looks like all changes will be handled in the client side so not applicable i assume as it is nowhere mentioned they would be writing custom js file the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code if same functionality is required in different file which could violate dry. team might need to consider such possibility. no the team is already optimizing by leverage some libraries. it would as user opts to sort but here it seems to be necessary evil. yes the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better.
1,the author has not used any diagram nor any other forms of pictorial representation.
1,although the textual explanation is succinct and nice there not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. i think diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.
1,unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. i would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view also add screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment and low fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.
1,the authors have not included any diagrams. though the purpose and proposed changes are understood the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.
1,although screenshots are available on the projects page it would have been easier to visualize if the page were added in the design document too.
1,although the write up explains the things clearly visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. suggestions you can include diagrams like use cases application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. you can mock the changes editing page to show proposed changes which will really help in better understanding of your design.
1,unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. i would suggest providing the simplified diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.
1,the design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.
1,the doc seems complete. all aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. a diagram may prove to be useful.
1,good job on ui and test cases. kindly add diagram.
1,the project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metrics. they have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change the view app views response and the partial app views submitted content self the screenshot of the existing ui of the review section and how the ui would look after the project with the inclusion of button to analyze and they have specified that displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked. i specifically like how the test plan includes their feature in the format. they have mentioned scenarios one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the displays the suggestion metrics. i wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics based on the review input. like for example there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed like how some reviewers mentally copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes. overall the team has done great job with the documentation and i look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review.
1,the design document contains some extra information such as whole paragraph about which i think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part.
1,the design includes all the required in the documentation document br hm swivel edit the main goal to let the ta be able to review any team that has submitted the assignment is well stated. i think some screenshots or other pictures will be more helpful while explaining the .
1,there no visual aids. i think other than screenshot of finalized result possible workflow diagram will also be useful the work design.
1, visual aids are missing entirely. no class diagrams are provided either. tip you could ve provided simple charts or er diagrams for the design
1,there are many visual aids used. it may be good idea to do some for this project.
1,the document specifies the problem statement and the analyze functionality they want to incorporate. however the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e analyze and the design document section is empty. suggestion you can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how. i think that you can remove the introduction section as mentioned by the professor.
1,the design incorporates most of the functionality required. it would be nice to have design diagram.
1,the authors have provided high level solution to the problem statement. they have mentioned that they are going to use an api for suggestion detection but have not yet identified one. suggestion you can survey on the existing apis and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with this will improve your write up significantly.
1,the explanation of how the received data will be stored presented is something i would suggest the team to add. the design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.
1,please add more information on the nlp algorithm team is trying to use.
1,changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.
1,the authors have not specified any code changes as of now so i can comment on it. suggestion you might want to add any api adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future api implementations.
1,more explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added. could have also added technologies to be used.
1,a simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working. suggestion i feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. for example what different possible methods will be implemented. or how the web service will be used or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection.
1,the design document seems to be incomplete. the team have done good job explaining their problem statement and have included their implementation in brief. if the team could build up on this and explain their implementation in more detail while adding few diagrams to explain the work they plan to do would be great. also the team have not mentioned any test cases they plan to implement.
1,the design looks incomplete. there are no diagrams or screenshots. could have added test plans as well.
1,only the problem statement and proposed solution are present it would be helpful to add the test plan asap.
1,please submit your design plan and add some visual aids.
1,the design doc looks more or less complete given that it is just phase one of the project. i feel that some screenshots and more detailed explanation would have been better.
1,it would be better to include testing plan.
1,there is no problem statement mentioned in the design document. it directly dives into the implementation details. this does not help the reader is understanding the need for project. there is no test plan project purpose. the team has tried to provide design implementation details which is not very descriptive. more effort is needed to enable reader to understand the design better
1,the design is likely to increase the response time since api requests take time. it is essential to implement system that keeps track of these api responses and disables this functionality when the api is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.
1,the team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach. so the team should detail their implementation and design for the reader to know what they plan to implement.
1,the design covers the but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. some more explanations was expected.
1, no the design approach is very high level over view. an mac design pattern is an obvious conclusion for incorporating any functionality in web application but more precise details of the design approach from the team can help the reader in long way in gaining understanding.
1,the team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not included any details. the team should elaborate on the implementation they plan to do.
1,the authors could have listed out the issues followed by solutions with diagram and some supporting screenshots. this makes the review easier.
1,i think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. as to the smell of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. so far though the design seems sound. there have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. i think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. for example i found the gem sentimental that the phrases into positive negative and neutral. i think this is something the authors can look into.
1,more effort should be expended on the designate current explanation talks only about changes in the view. it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.
1,more explanation regarding the solution would be helpful explaining which files must be changed etc.
1,test plan is blank.. the diagrams are good but little more writing on what you are planning to do would have been nice
1,team needs to work upon adding more content in the document. project design needs to be explained more with text and bullets. team should add test plan.
1,can elaborate more on the problem statement and the approach that you are planning to take
1,the proposed changes sounds good to me. but as i mentioned screenshots help in better understanding of the problem statement. moreover more detailed doc would have been better.
1,test plan missing. links section empty could have been provided or don mention it at all. no design proposed.
1,detailed design and test plan lacks. for introduction part the explanation is not clear enough and little bit confusing. it is better to add more explanation about what the project is and point out the exact purpose clearly.
1,explained the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed. test plan section is created but no description or plan is given.
1,there is lot of visual help which is good but project design could have been expanded upon more
1,the deign gives some use cases for this project but compared to all the functionality required for this project it is not enough. more detailed description about the design of other things need to be added such as model view.
1,i do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. suggestion i did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. that would have been useful. the test plan does mention viewsuggestionmetricsforreviewsegment though. if this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing.
1,the project purpose is stated but not extremely clearly. it seems that in the introduction part there just copy pasted messages from the question statement. the flowchart in the introduction part is good but where should this be implemented. it seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor administrator end instead of students end. but that not clearly stated in the project purpose part. the project design is also not very detailed. the title do some changes does seems to be very serious but apart from that the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements. the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough. it good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture. the testing plan is not stated at all..
1,the quality is of explanation is good and easy to follow. the team might want to add some low level details for the code changes.
1,i think the testing plan is missing others are good.
1,these explanations feel kinda minimalist
1,design plan of the document only explains algorithm or flow for the code change. team should explain the changes from existing system to proposed solution with some texts.
1,yes they include project purpose project design. it would be better if they include the testing plan.
1,you can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.
1,the flowchart in the design doc explains their problem purpose clearly. few improvements could be the document dint contain testing plan project purpose i.e introduction can be more detailed
1,as mentioned above the document lacks lot of details. the proposed changes have not been mentioned.
1,the project includes the problem statement. the team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids. however the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes.
1,problem statement and the expected flow are clearly explained. i somehow feel that the name of this project and the requirements problem statement are not matching. other missing items test plans diagrams except flow diagram. low level design details.
1, diagrams are not provided. please add it.
1,the design document looks incomplete with only the introduction and project purpose sections that are mostly copy pasted from the problem statement provided. the proposed design seems to be limited to just an image. also please consider changing the title do some changes to problem statement or something more appropriate.
1,the grammar in introduction may need improvement to be more understandable. for abbreviations it would be better to give explanations to help others understand.
1,the reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
1,according to the project requirement document br hm swivel edit heading h. oe x the design has nearly copy pasted all the textual explanation from here but there a lot of details that are remained unexplained is the underlying functionality already implemented and there just an ui change that remains to be done. if yes where is the underlying functionality. in which file. how is it implemented. if not then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document.
1,the team has included screenshots of the review ui. the first one depicts the existing look and the nd one shows that they plan to include new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display pop up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metrics. the team has also shown the user story in format and also described to scenarios one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input. the team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars diagrams for use case or sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.
1,they include the interface required. they should include more details about how the functionality should be implemented.
1,try to give class diagram to explain your implementation
1,the flow has been explained through diagram. but the proposed solution has not been given.
1,the team could explain the design solution in more comprehensive way. the team has only pasted the description given in the doc
1,since the document is mostly copy pasted from the problem statement it covers what needs to be done. but it has not discussed about how it needs to be done. adding the exact changes to be made makes it easier to understand the solution proposed.
1,not detailed design was provided. these information was not included.
1,the design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams but design to implement them is not absent.
1,the authors have provided mock up of their final design which seems pretty good. however what missing is diagrams. something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.
1,the screenshots posted give clear picture of the intended output. it would be nice to have design diagram.
1,it would be better to add more diagrams.
1,there are no such design explanations on which i can improve or suggest on. it would have been great if there were some more explanations.
1,the proposed design looks fine for now but more details are required in order to make better judgement. so i think that more effort should be expended.
1,author does not explain the approach they are going to use. team should add project purpose project design to show case how they are going to tackle the issue.
1,the changes being proposed here are not comprehensive. it just talks about adding an option allow students to join review later but it does say how. it also does say whether it a change in the administrator end or where. also as being stated in the above question is the underlying functionality already implemented and there just an ui change that remains to be done. if yes where is the underlying functionality. in which file. how is it implemented. if not then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document.
1,the authors have only mentioned about adding field to the view. more changes will be required in order to enforce the deadlines on the students. suggestion add section called design plan to the and mention rough idea of how you are going to approach the project.
1,they include the interface required. they should include more details about their design like how to implement and what need to be changed.
1,i think more effort should be expended on the design. the addition of mac suggested in the solution is vaguely explained.
1,the explanations were inadequate and could have been given more elaborately written. the document just contains the details given in the user story document by professor. more content can be added and the flow of logic can be added.
1,as stated above it is difficult to understand the team own solution to the given issue. the team could provide the paths to the files that they think should be changed. it would increase the readability of the documentation.
1,the changes are explained by the authors. the quality of the explanation can be improved. authors could have explained the changes little more elaborately. the explanation is little high level.
1,the authors have provided minimal explanation of the changes to be made. they have mentioned about the ui changes and not discussed further. it would be good to include the underlying changes. the team has identified view file under the potentially modified files. they have not explored the controller and other files that need to be modified in order to support this. a design document needs to politically portray your design and so it will be great if such details could be included.
1,the authors have provided mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. however the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since they have not added any class diagram use case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth. suggestion you might want to add diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write up
1,no visual aids are included. feel the team should include more visual aid to help the reader in understanding their problem and its implementation.
1,team can explain the algorithm they are going to follow or mention part of files they are going to make changes in. as changes do not seem heavy it should not increase system response time. team needs to put more efforts expended on the design and explain the efforts.
1,there are no diagrams or screenshots. please include the same in the following submissions to make the design document stronger.
1,i believe lot more effort should be on the design. as being addressed above there are lot of questions that are not addressed at all in this document. the formatting is not nice either.
1,no design has been yet proposed by the author however the goal of the project has been well described. most of the write up is the same as mentioned in the doc. suggestion expand more on what changes need to be done in order to achieve the end result.
1,they have included the initial design. it suggested that they include more details about the design.
1,the change is little and consists of only one file. should make the code smelly
1,the team has not submitted code that should be added implemented. suggestion the team can add code snippets in the documentation along with the file names in which the changes should be done.
1,code level details are not covered in the doc. but the changes suggested follow the desired requirements.
1,the authors have added the methods in the right class. the code is properly. appropriate gems have been used. the new system does not increase the response time and is efficient. more effort could have been put in the documentation by providing more diagrams and also by designing test plan.
1,the authors have talked about only the ui and not the underlying code. so it is difficult to assess the quality of the change. as far as the ui is concerned the authors have taken right direction to place the providing further details about the proposed solution including the changes needed in the controller code to support the ui change will help explain it.
1,a use case diagram is provided in the documentation. the team should add class diagram as well to give an idea of the low level implementation.
1,yes visual aid has been provided in the form of flow charts and screen shots. could added.
1,the diagrams are very very large on the seepage consider making them half the size.
1,team has added diagram that explains the problem statement and its effects very well. team could add diagrams to explain the application changes sequence of actions state actors involved.
1,there a flow chart about how the end result look like. but the flow chart only tells user story. there no detailed implementation plan in this flow chart. some diagrams are too high level design and do not provide enough details. applies here.
1,team has major include diagrams for the code change and algorithm flows. team should add diagrams to explain flow of the application change sequence of actions actors involved.
1,the authors have included flowchart which concisely explains the functionality that the authors are going to add. they have also included screenshots of the ui showing the end result in the after image. diagrams are not included. please add will give an understanding of how the implementation will be done.
1,the diagrams is detailed and easy to understand. but it is bit too long. the team can simplify it.
1,screenshots which were included was explanatory. more figures such as logic flow etc can be added for better understanding.
1,use case diagrams explain the requirements properly but no system design related diagram or mock ups are given.
1,no diagrams are present would help reviewers better understand what is going on.
1, have been given stating what the end product will look like. but i did not find any diagrams or tables. suggestion the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.
1,the document contains flow diagram that analyses the system requirements and expected flow. however it can certainly make use of other diagrams in the expected flow section to give more clarity about the requirements and the sequence of actions.
1,a flow chart is depicted in the documentation. however other diagrams could have been represented to show the structure and the sequence of the project. the flow chart depicted is little high level. the total capacity of the project could have been represented by more diagrams.
1,diagrams for use cases are given properly but the class diagram is missing.
1,the flow diagram used is basically pictorial representation of the problem statement and so it does not really add any more value. it would be really helpful if the authors could include real flow diagram that shows the actual flow of events. the screenshots provided help us to understand what changes the authors are expecting in the ui.
1,the flow charts are good and help lot in understanding the work. again. it would be better to explain the abbreviations.
1,unfortunately there were no visual aids provided even though they went through the plan in good way but few diagrams would definitely help.
1,it would be better to add some diagrams.
1,there are no visual aids given. maybe some flow charts or screenshots can be added to help people understand the project.
1,no diagrams included in the document. adding some diagrams to explain what the system is and how the design will look like will be better.
1,there is seepage linked which is helpful but i do not see any other visual aids. it would be better to have some screenshots to help the reader understand your project.
1,the team did good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and providing their proposed solutions. the purpose of the project is clear from the document as is composite of several independent issues. the problem is that testing plan is missing from the project. i would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality e.g. one spec per issue and then elaborating from there. moreover while fixing some issues like and consists of small modification to the existing code there are other cases where the design decisions are not provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns. the document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive.
1,following can be added. project introduction motivation description of project
1,everything looks great as they have added the diagrams ad explained everything in detail. test plan is missing which can be added as they are solving lot of issues in this project.
1,the design document is extremely well written. the project purpose is mentioned although it looks similar to what is already mentioned in the design document. i would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project how this project is helpful to the system. why are these changes project necessary. additionally i would also suggest the team to add test plan section to their documentation. any bugs fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge cases as well as core functionality
1,the project design is well presented and solves all issues. however testing plan and project purpose are missing. you could have given at least basic high level overview of testing in the end overall good effort.
1,the design incorporates all the functionality required. suggestion including screenshots or screen would make the document easier to understand.
1,the issues are addressed thoroughly. but probably the issue on staggered deadline needs to be handled carefully the solution might cause other code effects need to cover all the individuals involved
1,its good can be more elaborate also in sections where you have added the code changes you ca add comments to the code as well for better understanding.
1,for the bugs which have explanations the proposed fixes and explanations of the problem are sound. i like more info on bugs and as they only have the flow.
1,the explanations are well written and describe the workflow well. there could have been little more detail in the explanation as some of the statements are very high level.
1,a fix for the second and fourth issues is missing at the current moment. if this is included as in the other issues then the document will adequately propose solutions. also perhaps more elaboration on the rd fix on how the columns are not being copied over i know the code is pasted but simple worded explanation would be nice too.
1,overall work is done good. but explanations are bit lengthy and somewhat hard to follow. ther is no need to mention the existing the documentation lengthier.
1,the design looks bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system. it can make the code smelly. too complicated code handled in issue which could be 
1,the design is well though of however instead of writing the time difference logic gems could have been used which are well tested and bug free.
1,i would appreciate little more detail on bugs and which have flow established but no code snippets.
1,i don think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. they are modifying the right files. the new design does not appear to potentially make the code smelly. but for few issues you haven added any files which you ll be modifying only the is given you can add them before the final submission.
1,the team has provided solutions for all the issue but one. for issue the team has only provided flow chart description of the issue graphically but the code which needs to be changed added should be looked upon. suggestion the team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the files and the logic behind the proposed solution.
1,the designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems. however the design decisions for issues and are missing and therefore cannon be assessed. i would suggest including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that are going to be addressed in this project. posting the exact solution is not necessary.
1,the diagrams provided clearly explain the flow control of the proposed solutions. the team even mentions preconditions needed for the flow control. the only suggestion i have is that the team could also add low fi sketch or screenshot of how the view would like after before after issue is fixed.
1,document is explained well with clear understanding of the issue. problem statement design plan is explained well. team can work on adding test plans. as well as well diagrams and screenshots to make the document more explanatory.
1,document is explained well. also the flow of document is good. team can add screenshots of existing documents also some diagram to explain the solution well.
1,no diagrams included in the document. please include application flow diagram state diagram or sequence diagram or use case diagrams to make the document for readable.
1,the team has explained the problem statement well and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them. however the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project.
1,only single diagram is present but i have appreciated couple of flow charts to accompany the expected flows.
1,the problem statements and design have been explained. but the team could have explained how they have planned to carry out the changes. though this could be vague idea it could have been added. likewise with the test plan too.
1,the design document describes the problem statement the approach towards the goal and the flow expected for the given issue. certain improvements can be made to the introduction by providing brief overview of the project details instead of introducing the environment. the team plans on updating the test plan after implementation.
1,the document contains use case diagram that analyze the system requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. it helps to understand the overview of the project details. however it can certainly make use of flow diagram in the expected flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. the flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in serial order.
1,the test plan is not yet done. rest i could see that the document is very much complete.
1,except for the test plan the design doc seems to have all the important details. the team should add test plan before starting in order to go for test driven development.
1,i think the design perfectly captures the view part. however it looks bit high level. i think more low level and model related details can be added. for e.g. what design pattern would be used the tables that will be affected.
1,i think overall it looks good. however bit more low level details may give better insight about such issues.
1,i think the diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.
1,the design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. files that will be changed along with how functionality will work flow are included in the doc clearly. suggestion great work. no suggestions required.
1,the problem statements are much detailed but they could be more concise. the test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation.
1,the design covers all the major aspects well. i feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in much better way.
1,the explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. but the does not include any test plans as of now. there are few test cases which can be used to write the test plan for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.
1,design is very nicely explained with flowchart makes the design flow very clear. suggestion if screenshot of actual screen where the change needs to be made is added that would be perfect.
1,the overall quality of explanations is precise and clear. issue and the test plan can be addressed in more detail. how the testing will be performed must be addressed.
1,the issue explanation ans issue solution explanation is bit hard to follow or seems to be at high level. it needs to be broken down. all other descriptions are easy to follow. it would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.
1,great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. the design will definitely increase the response time. suggestion information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document availability of such info would have been helpful.
1,as stated above all the references needs to be checked as sign sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.
1,there is nothing wrong in current design. looks good. suggestion however since i have already worked on similar assignment so i know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. you can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. have look at oss project topic. check with the professor once.
1,the use of flowcharts describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. suggestion including screen to your doc will add more weight to it.
1,the diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. suggestion test plan is not so clear. especially the second where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. what dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. a similar flow chart will make it very clear as to what you plan to test.
1,the design document looks really good. all sections are properly described screenshots included. a possible or workflow diagram would have been appreciated.
1,this documentation is the first one to clearly give background for the project out of all the documentation that i have reviewed until now. kudos to the team for taking that extra mile. they have clarified the purpose of this project under the task heading as to provide holistic insight into the performance of each student in class as an objective. the project design includes the view and controller section that projects the requirements of the project. i like how the team has listed all the information to be presented in the grade summary. the documentation finally contains the test plan where they propose to do controller tests to check if the correct model method is called and if the objects of appropriate are returned and also if the correct view is rendered. they have also listed feature tests to see if the correct information is being rendered on the view. the team could have added more such tests like to test if the sorting functionality works fine
1,the design doc is clear and well written. the authors have done great job explaining the project purpose and their design plan with the use of loft sketch and prototype for the required view. i would suggest the team to include files that are involved for this project. overall good work.
1,the design does incorporate all of the one suggestion that i can give in the context of the design is that the documentation could have covered the list of files that they plan to work on and the current version of that code. they could have shown diagram of the flow of activities for lucid understandability
1,the design incorporates all the primary functionality however adding diagram would make it much better
1,the proposed changes look good explanations are clear. also mentioned the continuous talk with mentor to come up with prototype. suggest you to include screenshots of some positive and negative tests in the future submissions.
1,the authors have proposed to create view for grade summary with the details pertaining to the assignment grades topics review scores and total scores for each student which gets rendered when assessment tab icon is clicked. this change seems logical. they have also depicted low sketch of the projected page and screenshot of rough prototype. these changes seem logical to me. i wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited as prior work in the background. the documentation could have added specifics of the files that they wish to modify or create.
1,the explanations are succinct. however in the controllers section it is unclear which controller in project the authors are referring to. the authors could mention the name of the controller they intend to change and also possible method that might be added to it.
1,the explanation is good and more information on which files would be changed would be more helpful.
1,the authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify. so i am not in position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly. the design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems. the response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information. the team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information. or they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students say under specific course year at given university the authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions like code modifications file changes and diagrams which can be easily incorporated by the next review.
1,they might like to elaborate more on how they plan to use the hash of students to retrieve the specific information of the assignments. for eg. what models will you be using to query the db.
1,the overall look of the page is well explained. however i could not understand the back end design plan as in how where the team will be adding such features in the code.
1,the authors view of the final result is clear but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented. i.e what files are going to be changed.
1,this is the only place i found the authors could improve. there is no mention of the actual files that need to be modified. they have detailed out the change that they propose but no mention of actual files and the code change. it would be further increase the clarity of the solution if you could include that too.
1,the authors have put in good amount of effort in creating low sketch table of the grade summary view with mock data. they have included rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information. the documentation also shows the manage courses view which contains the assessment icon that links to the grade summary page. one suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow as flowchart or even useful diagrams for 
1,missing but loved the addition of the loft sketch.
1,the requirement here document br hm swivel edit heading h. oe x totally appeared in the design document. this is very good because there a high level goal being stated. however the important files part which includes the open issue delayed mailer response controller and response model only model is mentioned and the other four are not mentioned at all. it should be great if all of these can be mentioned.
1,both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated. in terms of project purpose although i was expecting it to appear in the introduction part it actually did not. the part just stated high level abstract goal being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. but it not at all stated in detail. so i went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. in the proposed solution section neither project purpose nor project design was well put. it talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. but they are not talked about in detail. this sentence loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score seems to be not so easy to be understood. the project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. there no detailed modification plan workflow statement or anything. the testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for tester to use and check the functionality.
1,there no diagrams or any other visual aids available. i would suggest adding at least some workflow diagram.
1, more effort should be expended on the design. i think there are lot of problems in the design. the changes to the controller where the notification is implemented such questions are not addressed. also the questions listed in the above answers are not addressed.
1,the authors have included all the necessary sections of the design document. however the document seems to be very high level explanation of the problem statement and proposed solutions. suggestion you can try elaborating more on the problem statement and the current scenario of the project. e.g. try explaining what is the threshold for sending an email notification to the users.
1,the authors have provided brief design approach of storing the and looping it into an email notification so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. improvisation you can try adding information about new functions you wish to add and if yes which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. this will increase the depth of your design document.
1,the team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. they has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. however it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen. the team has also proposed short test plan on very high level which makes senses as this is very early level of the project but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of self review extension.
1,the design related information is missing. the team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. they need to add diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.
1,the design documents looks very crisp and clear. the work flow proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. good work. a screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better.
1,the design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases. however there are some things which i found incomplete. in the problem statement they should first of mention proper definition of what is meant by self review as the term is bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the ui aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed
1,the doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. more detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document
1,i don think anything is missing from their document but it is in general lite. i would prefer few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until self review is complete or which places they plan on making changes.
1,the problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. however some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. test plan is not stated in details. it just mentions bullet points. in test driven development adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing solution as per the problem statement. this should be corrected.
1,it looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. suggestion they can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the to the reviews how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. they can also add basic flow of their proposed solution. this will enhance the explanation.
1,the new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions thus i cannon comment on this. suggestion you can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful.
1,visual aids are absent from the write up. suggestions use cases for email notification can be added. template design of the new modified email can be added. any relevant design pattern diagram can be added.
1,yes the are present. it would have been good if the issues were listed sequentially following its solutions.
1,yes all the requirements mentioned in the problem statement are considered. also the corresponding solutions are explained. a flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution just like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.
1,could have been explained more
1,needs to work bit on the plan
1,the project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. the team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. this explanation is clear and concise. however i would also suggest the team to add basic test plan on how they would test the functionality they add. also i suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing.
1,the explanations are good. but layout in the issue solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.
1,the authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. the idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical but i would suggest them to include dummy example or sample so that the english explanation is backed up with an idea of the code as well. such as this review x is submitted loop through review if abs review score review x score some value store review in list
1,the author has given proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grades
1,the team has not provided any visual representation of the work they propose to do. perhaps the mentioned above could instead be shown as set of diagrams showing an example for how this functionality would be handled when one say review has score disparity of more than the threshold for existing reviews. the idea here is not to add working screenshots but low fi diagram would also help in making the documentation visually more representative.
1,some screenshots of actual sent and proposed format of the new email would be helpful
1,could be more specific especially with test plan.
1,i think you explained the change they want to make clear but maybe you can state which file you want to make and how you guys want to change that file.
1,the team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. however as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement.
1,yes they include all the functionality in the page. they can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.
1,they have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. but where this method is planned to be added in is unclear. this needs to be mentioned.
1,they did explain what they want to do. it easy to understand and seems reasonable. they can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.
1,it would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model. this will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the smell category.
1,this design is good. there are no visual aids. maybe they can consider use it to make it more detailed.
1,need improvements can add design by adding diagrams and test plans. technical details with class diagram to explain the code level implementation would have been better.
1,the team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. it would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.
1,application flow is present and done well. diagrams need to be added.
1,there is hint of visual aid in terms of the section of application flow for the instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get sense of putting things into perspective. none. both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended the diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. the diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go bit more into detail.
1,the application flow help understands how your design work but maybe you can add more visual aids to help understand your design more easily.
1,the current explanation talks only about changes in the view. it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.
1,the placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema. they have also not included the test cases
1,the document seems to be generally well designed. however i believe that they have glossed over how link is said to be closed. they properly described the additional functionality and the challenges they will likely face.
1,there are no sections titled project purpose project design or testing plan. however much of the information required to create those sections is provided.
1,the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objectives that need to be achieved. the team explains well the purpose and project design. they have included the database tables which will be modified. the team could add testing plan to make the design document look complete.
1,everything looks great you can add test plan for this as its big change in 
1,i felt there was just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year project. even if the current project is to extend previous one the documents are supposed to be copied almost word to word. the only major addition i see is the last section. none of the diagram correlate to the new changes being made they are contextual to the older project. testing plan is missing from the document. from what i know even the development projects need that section. even when the older document was used no references have been provided for it.
1,the introduction paragraph contains bullets that are identical to e which is surprising. the flowchart does not cover no or negative cases and is thus incomplete. what is logged in the db and how exactly is start and end time is very ambiguous. apart from mention of merging the data of the details page on the current report page. in the introduction i cannon see any further discussion of this particular objective. for auto save you could think of using the on unload event of like unload event. also does seem to be an efficient idea since that would make too many number of calls from the page i guess you would be sending an ajax request which is asynchronous. a next call might be made before previous call response is handled. when you say for each time the reviewer starts review it will check whether previous record for this review already exists in the database. if it does exist then it will update the end time of this record what if i open review that i had done two days back. as soon as i open the page will it mark end time as now. in that case does that mean i have done this review for days..
1,the design incorporates all the required the team could have added use cases or crc cards to help convey which parts of code they plan to change and how. overall the team conveys their objectives.
1,no all are not incorporated. design and implement solution that handle is missing.
1,while i understand conceptually i don believe they explained their changes in appropriate detail. simply describing additional columns and flow chart misses the biggest part of these changes which is user experience. how will windows pop up. what will the new data look like after review is complete.
1,the authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. they could benefit from drawing simple loft ui cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their ui design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it. overall the have explained the process in detail and clean fashion.
1,the feature is pain right now and it is buggy not sure if it is in the scope of this project so an option can be given to choose the data after set of intervals like mins
1,explanation is good and easy to understand. proposed solution looks good as well. design and implement solution that handle been explained.
1,the introduction was little confusing as to what this team is going to do. rather the objective of the project section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that i was able to understand what already exists. the objective of the project section contains the proposed solutions when the proposed solutions ought to be separate section.
1,i think the writing could be done better with more explanation on why the solutions mentioned in the last paragraph are taken and what other approaches were considered. or an explanation of why no alternative exists. with regard to design explained in detail in previous comment.
1,these changes seem to be appropriate for the objectives they have. only small set of files are being changed and the functionality is isolated well. my only feedback here is that there is likely place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking.
1,the authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. the changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow dry principles. they might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. this will help in reducing convoluted code.
1,it in clear what all the review statistics will be shown in the column. if it is just the time spent then that fine. but if there are other details as well then it needs to be explained how so much data will be shown in single cell o affecting readability.
1,as mentioned earlier the flowchart and simple er diagram are helpful but i believe these changes would benefit greatly from having low fi sketches and actor diagrams instead of flow charts.
1, they have included the flowchart of the flow of the functionality that is being added which seems to be designed properly and readable. also database table are going to change is depicted. they could add class responsibility collaborators cards to further illustrate the code changes they are about to make.
1,would be nice to see sample test plan
1,created great visual aid which helps us explain the plan.
1,the authors have explained the changes to be made to the system including screenshots of the tables diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. suggestion although all the details are explained well in the document by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using diagram the document will be easier to read.
1,the design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. ui views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. moreover the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the query library will be used for three types of sorting. one minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link table with the library for better readability.
1,the authors have explained about their changes neatly including previous suggestions. they have added detailed description about which they plan to implement. the is used to sort data for multiple fields for table using multi body sorting. they plan to use it in the grades and review mapping views. they do not plan to implement in their drop down but display the sorted data itself on loading the page. the changes look more clear to me as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi body sorting for submissions table. i think that introduction to is highly unnecessary and should be removed
1,yes the changes are well explained. there are lot of pictures snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made. there one issue that the screenshots are not very clear since it big. it would look better of the screenshots can be clearer.
1,yes the design is the simplest i could think about. but it does include how to change the files. i think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. on the other hand the expected result seems to be too long. there too many screenshots
1,the screenshots of the expected result and the diagram are good but the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user friendly. the diagram can be better if it designed as design plan diagram instead of user diagram which simply states how the reader is to approach this. or it could be better if we have both.
1,the authors have included diagram which explains flow of the diagram the document does not strike balance in the use of visualization. it lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use cases mock up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. the mock up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. also there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams as the modifications are limited to views.
1,there is some explanation about the general idea of what needs to be added to implement the new functionality however there are several sections missing that give light to the details of implementation and how this is tested to ensure correctness. adding description of where and how this new model will be developed with the existing image would be beneficial for thorough understanding of the reader. this could also be achieved by rearranging the logic of the sections as sum sections elude to purpose and intent of implementation.
1,a detailed explanation would have been better
1,the stated design seems to be appropriate. following close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful. it would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used.
1,yes the design proposed by the author seem sound enough. however the author has only given high level view of the proposed design. the author should delve deeper into the concept more while describing the intended design.
1,i appreciate the thought of using delegation pattern. more details on this would have been helpful. also why was delegation pattern selected in particular.
1,visualization are great for helping to clarify system analysis and relations in this portion of the image. more images on the design and implementation would also be great addition for further understanding.
1,the diagrams are supposedly the best part of the gives very lucid and engaging representation of the underlying architecture if the system. also clearly depicts the understanding of the problem by the team.
1,the visuals are very helpful. more clear view of how delegation pattern is being used would have been appreciable.
1,the team has included the diagrams related to current system analysis and the workflow. a workflow explains the current design and its similarity with the existing flow used for topics biding. the team could have included some ui mock ups as well to show the views for better understanding.
1,the section is included by the content is empty. simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here.
1,no it does not since the approach is to have new model with delegation i strongly recommend team to add test cases that ensure systems are working as it is
1,the doc is very well outlined but the team must have invested some amount in test cases. it would be really helpful to see how the new controller be tested and how the chosen pattern is able to help in the desired functionality.
1,the document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the change request. however the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself. the team might also add link for this document so that it could be included in the links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to wider audience.
1,yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however i feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. they could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed
1, the design seems to be sound. there are lot of mention of which files will be modified however as i said in the previous round there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. suggestion team could mention what tables are present in the database of the project. i believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on projects and have no knowledge of projects. at the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.
1,yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. i would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.
1,yes looks clean. any design patterns used..
1,yes the design appears to be sound. there could be some rearrangement in the mock up layout e.g. text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for better user interface.
1,yes the design is appropriate. it would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use.
1,they team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. they have created diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. as mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the system.
1, in the diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. in the instructor flow chart the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.
1,the diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. one can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. however in one of the instructor flow diagram it given that if the instructor status is pending the instructor will set the limit to. that does make sense. why would the instructor himself herself set the limit to. in this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin. suggestions change the yes branch of is pending. to loop times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only students to an assignment.
1,yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. it would be nice if there were more diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions. presence of screens is good. that helps in understanding what is being implemented. it would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system
1,class diagrams are missing. class diagrams are missing. first flow diagram looks perfect. second needs some modifications the instructor login flow should not include step to set the count limit to. this should have been done before only. you should add step to perform check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit. if yes then don add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. if no then add the student.
1,the mock uis are well thought of and make navigation easier. a couple of suggestions can add another mock ui showing the drop down. some types of reports may not exist. if the drop down options are hard coded selecting an option might lead to page with no content this might be an existing issue i suspect. for every option you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down.
1, the test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of test cases which test all the for the admin and the instructor role. it also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then students to his her course.
1,the and flow charts used by the teams are good but can be made more clear and appealing
1,the diagram is good but the diagram in the test plan is not very helpful i suggest either another ish diagram or just list of the features from the report controller.
1,tests can be made more exhaustive. for now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.
1,the visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern use cases to explain the test plan. the class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team and it succeeds in explaining. they have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review. a sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other as the design suggests so.
1,from the previous stage the team has added the use case diagram that efficiently describes the actors involved in the process. also since new controller is proposed it was essential to identify the role of the instructor.
1, yes they have improved the diagram from last round and it a standard class diagram. it very self explanatory. though the diagram under test plan should be clearer. also there could have been sample report generated for reference.
1,i would the test section incomplete. the authors have mentioned about test cases thats all. i think that is not at all sufficient. also missing are unit tests if any and ui tests if any. i would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as ui tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system
1,test plan needs to be expanded to describe each unit functional test team plans to write for each of the reports.
1,the testing plan is very neat and comprehensive. they could have handled more edge cases.
1,the test plan covers all the reports and their creation as well as data to be rendered using the new button added. you can try adding edge test cases i.e. the code should not break if data is empty for report. they have not yet posted the complete plan of testing and plan to update as per the progress. i would suggest you to take time to define testing strategy as it will help in add which speeds up the process highly.
1,yes the design includes test plan. it adequate to test all functionality of the newly introduced controllers. it does talk in detail about the ways the system is to be tested and what is the exact outcome to be verified.
1,the team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. however they have not included any design explanation explicitly. they have not described the approach they have come with. it might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having glance at the design pattern.
1,the technical changes required are explained in depth but the unease or the domain knowledge is not provides properly. this makes it difficult to understand the problem statement properly. some high level domain knowledge and requirements background will be helpful.
1,the flowchart added gives good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed. suggestion a diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.
1,yes the team has made very good testing plan consisting of functional testing which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added modified. however the author could have added code snippets of the same instead of just discussing the proposed plan.
1,i suggest the testing plan be improved. in place of giving steps on how reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. the spec could be something like expect have content sorted
1, the test plan has covered test cases for testing of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. they can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display flash message saying no entries to be sorted. in this way try to add few negative testing to improve your coverage. this will make your code more rigid.
1,the test plan is present. it consists of set of functional tests described for each of the five views. i would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize spec moreover it would be better if the team provided rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.
1,the test plan is complete and covers all intended they have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. good documentation on test plan. as client side changes using script is added latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.
1,as stated above the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. however they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. the code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. this would help the future developers to understand the code in simple manner.
1,actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.
1,they only presents flow chart it will be better if there is diagram.
1,yes the design includes test plan. i think the tests can be more descriptive including what is being tested and in which scenario the test is being implemented.
1,i feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering few edge cases.
1,the changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. the filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. however it would be better if they started by giving short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.
1,the design documents is well explained. the authors haven mentioned any design pattern as such. the authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added and crc cards.
1,the document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. however i would suggest them to properly structure the document. one finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.
1,the bar charts have been added to the design report. the visualization have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. the only thing that i would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. as in they could have added details for label and label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.
1,the document does include flowchart which shows the flow of changes. however an diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.
1,the test plan section is included however only the framework to be used is discussed. i would suggest them to include little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.
1,the authors have described the changes to be made. however these are very abstract and require some technical depth
1,the changes necessary are explicitly outlined. though more description as to why certain files need to be modified would be nice to have.
1,as said in the previous review though the ui explains the it could have been more legible.
1,test plan is discussed in the write up. it could have been supported with some use cases.
1,yes the design is sound and appropriate however it may be better to implement more code level design.
1,the test plan is completed. just one suggestion that it can be more specific. for example it may include some real test cases.
1, create class diagram and diagram outlining the set of actions that the reviewer and the author can perform.
1, document includes test plan. however can include more test cases.
1,content is good and well written from the last review i was expecting little more in depth on the implementation side. i see no edits after nov except for the new image
1,diagram included in the implementation plan is confusing. a better way would have been to include diagram to indicate the step by step flow.
1,the ui are good. i not entirely sure that the diagram is effective perhaps better diagram style would work better.
1,several tests are listed and described. i would suggest adding more details for each test as there is some vagueness as to what each described action entails.
1, the design appears to be well made. however due to lack of more detail i am unable to judge it correctly. what changes need to be made in the files is not mentioned.
1, yes the design is simple however as stated above it is very succinct and abstract. only which files are going to be edited are written. what methods interfaces will be modified is not mentioned.
1, the diagrams have been enlarged and are now visible. good improvement. however i still feel that computer made would have looked cleaner.
1, yes the design includes test plan in the end. this too is very abstract about lines total and just states the use cases. tip use the it should format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.
1,they have diagram which pretty much does it job. i am not in favor of the ui they have put. they could have used any software for the same which would have made it legible.
1,ui and diagrams are descriptive. however more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem
1,test plan too brief. could add scenarios and description.
1,even though few test cases have been provided i feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps involved in the testing.
1,the issues have been identified and documented clearly. however little more of explanation is required for the solutions proposed for issues. they seem to me at very high level.
1,yes the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. this includes the flow diagrams diagrams and many of the screenshots. good work team. suggestion could include screenshots if any of the test plans implemented.
1,the author has very well given background of the system and the problem which forms lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. however the author has only given very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. there is not much of an explanation nor an implementation.
1,yes they have been thorough in their approach and this has been project implemented to perfection. they have not only given proper diagrams and the like but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the diagram for review section.
1,the problems are described very nicely. when it comes to changes to be made files to be modified are given. i feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.
1,the doc is very well written. its like blueprint to the project. really appreciate the team efforts.
1,team have explained the problem steps to reproduce are really very clear. solution part could have been explained better. overall its good work
1,the team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. the has complete details related to requirements analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job. the team did great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues. the ui mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand.
1,mostly yes. but the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.
1,given diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change
1,there are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated. suggestions it would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.
1,the author has made test plan but it is reactive instead of proactive. the test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.
1,make include more details for test plan other than that the looks very good.
1,tests are given at very high level and need to be described properly.
1,the team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation how the team will be testing it what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. how an end user can test the end to end requirements should also be part of the design.
1,test plans are present but have not explained in detail. a brief description of the use case with the test plan and spec would be perfect
1,documentation can be improved. include more details about the controllers method team is planning to change add.
1,design looks clear just need to add what files will be added and what files will be modified to make the design more sound.
1,yes it seems very sound. they list what they are going to do in fields.
1,yes it seems like sound however the authors could add some principles and patterns into it.
1,maybe add class diagram but newly added flowchart and database diagram make the design more clear.
1,the team have done good job explaining their project. but i feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. also the test cases should have been included in more detail.
1,overall the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. however the need for the rails internationalization api in addition to the cloud translation api was not explained. also the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing which should have been explained in more detail.
1,the changes are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make changes. only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done.
1,yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. i think i wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting. also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table they could have pasted the new schema in the doc
1,no design found on the not sure if any design diagram is needed but flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.
1,the design is quite good. it clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. however the only suggestion would be to include more diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable.
1,design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. i would expect that here. they also state that they are using translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful
1,the design is simple the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of course and adding multi language support in the design. one suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated but dynamic strings will remain in english.
1,the authors have explained well regarding their design approach to support hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. i think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.
1,the explanations are more than sufficient. not only have the authors explained the changes to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. i like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could ve integrated the metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.
1,yes. the team intends to use grade controller to show metric which would be good place to implement this functionality. the idea to involve instructors because of requests hour limit may complicate the project. another idea would be to update metrics with round robin scheduling of get requests.
1,yes they included some design principles which is good. maybe the authors could add some design patterns into 
1,maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots.
1,the design appears to be sound for most part of it. the linking between the different sections seems appropriate. the only issue i have is with the mock up in the design details second change mock up number. i think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. i feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because it is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until few days weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. so that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show the duration of each project varies from project to project. assignment had duration of about days. this would mean that there would be about bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the ta instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. suggestions instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to bar chart for each week or one in days. and then maybe towards the deadline or like week before the deadline you could switch to per day. or provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like week days day etc.
1,yes the api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains
1,there were mock ups of the final result of the project however there were no diagrams. i think the diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. maybe they could have done mock up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. especially the pages with flash messages if any. currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.
1,the idea to involve instructors because of requests hour limit may complicate the project. another idea would be to update metrics with round robin scheduling of get requests.
1,though this project does require any diagram as such. however flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.
1,the screenshots for the view are great they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how external entity interacts with the system and gets response. since the authors are using external api it would have been good if they could give more details request and response
1, have clearly mentioned when will api be hit to retrieve the data and which gem will be used.
1,yes the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. i would have liked to see section on caching if any. rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system
1,the team have written test plan. but i feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.
1,the test plan is clear and effective but shallow. manual testing is good but more description should be provided for the automated testing.
1,as there are ui changes test plan is not required but basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
1,use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see sequence diagram to understand the flow.
1,the design includes brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely the regular steps to update course page to hindi checking if edit assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from student login could have been included. the authors specify that spec and capybara is used for testing the new feature.
1,the use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. the symbol for an should be stick figure not rectangle. but that is minor error. also the use case diagram details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. i think the student as an actor should be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores thus requiring no involvement from the students at that point in of primary sequence in the use case diagram details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.
1,there are enough aids such as diagrams and screen shots. the authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. although i would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes
1,the test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. they can add more about the test cases if possible.
1,the test plan does include high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. i would suggest the team should add bed tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.
1,the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge cases may need to be considered at later stage.
1,few more test cases can be added
1,few test plan is written. the team can add more test plan.
1,good test plan. should include more test cases that check the functionality of integration. eg if number of lines of code committed by student is correctly computed.
1,the design includes test plan. however the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. it just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the metrics data palette team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what are they going to test.
1,the background is clear and thorough but the explanation of the changes to be made to the system lack detail. terms such as dom the blob api and were not explained.
1,i am giving this zero because of concerns of plagiarism. your page has multiple sections that are direct copy pastes of the that you linked to. you either need to write something original or site that this is not your work. consider having shorter summary of these sections and link to the other for greater background as you have already done.
1,the page feel more like project report instead of page. they should not tell people to go through the following page instead they should just tell the page is previous work.
1,they list the files to be changed for the final stage of the project but the description of what will be changed is still lacking. i love to see screenshots of added code or an explanation of what is and is not needed.
1,the document clearly mentions the requirement of the project with the problem statement.
1,authors have clearly explained what needs to be done and how it would be done.
1,yes the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as part of the oss project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as part of the final project. detailed information on the changes already made is available as link to the previous document. this document clearly captures the implementation of the and rust files. the design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of implementation of the renderingcontext d and enabling of the blob api for testing the code. the authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on though the text is lucid lack of visual tool like flow charts tables or diagrams to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the proposed and the interlinking of various modules. so one suggestion at this point is that the authors could have included visual representation of the design. apart from that the document is well made and credits to the team.
1,the authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system. ot would have been better if some visual modes are added.
1,the authors do great job of explaining the technical details and the api functionality of the requirements. furthermore they provide list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project. however the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes. for example the description of high level changes pertaining to the d is adequate but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out.
1,duplicating code and fixing it for the new implementation is an effective strategy but not very dry and could result in code that is hard to maintain read and test.
1,there is less about what they gonna do but more about before and after part
1,need to include flow diagram
1,the design sounds good but that largely due to how vague it is naturally we want to add the things we need to add and remove the things we need to remove.
1,the authors have not mentioned the name of the design pattern used but have mentioned the steps for implementation.
1,the high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable. the problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution. i would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader. for example the authors talk about refusing the code of d and it would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified. for example patterns like decorator or adapter would be relevant for this case.
1,not very well. lack of the use case.
1,the design feels simple and not much different from the one i saw in round in my perspective because i have already reviewed the project in the previous round. but to new reviewer it might not be that direct at first as they need to understand the base of the project and the first phase of implementation which is covered in the document of the previous project.
1,the main thread behind the design seems to be refusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality. this is great idea. it is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e.g. not reinventing the wheel. one suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied is not directly used as this would be more dry approach. in case if this is not possible then providing proper reasoning and justification would be helpful.
1,though the team have explained their work pretty well the team should think about adding few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project. currently the team have not used any diagrams.
1,it would be nice to see of the off screen canvas.
1,a suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the does would be helpful.
1,still no visualization of any kind
1,the design does not include any kind of diagram. it would have been better if flowchart or class diagram could have been included in the document.
1,the current document does not include visualization tool inclusion of such tool would have made the document more readable. nevertheless the link to the of the previous document includes flow diagram that clearly outlines the code flow of how the control flows from the incorporation of web ill file to its rust implementation in .rs to the dom implementation and finally to the 
1,it would have been better if some screenshots and diagrams was added to the design doc to better explain the functionality.
1,there are no diagrams present in the document. while the diagrams for apis and class interactions may have been helpful they are not necessary for this project as the authors provide detailed explanation of the relevant 
1,hough the team have explained their work pretty well the have not included test plan. it is an important part of the project and should be included
1,the test plan is clear but shallow. finer grain tests should be described not simply functional tests.
1,no there is no test plan
1,it would have been better if test plan covering changes made to the system was added to the design doc.
1,the test plan is not included in the design document. while the instances of testing are certainly mentioned e.g. specific could be tested by writing custom file and then running it the similar way. and finally we ll test our code by enabling the blob api. the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested.
1,yes this is the best design i have reviewed. it has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great and it very well made with very good design details and objectives. it also included the current scenario and typical score table. it should be great if there an expected final outcome visualization as well.
1,authors adequately explained the changes to be made to the system but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to be implemented to achieve the goal.
1,the explanation is inadequate needs more textual explanation of the problem and approach
1,team did not explained project well with the description. diagrams do explain the approach but for reader to get the overview but text description is also important. team can work on adding text description. same had been suggested in the last review.
1,just small explanation of the proposed solution has been given. they could clearly explained more.
1,the authors used lot of charts for use cases this is great but they only explained little for implementation which could be explained in great detail.
1,the design is clear at high level but lacks detail. the report described what the project is but how will this feature be implemented.
1,the authors have provided use cases for creating new subclass of questionnaire however more details can be added to the implementation section such as what new methods will be doing and test plans.
1,the team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. the documents lacks the changes the changes that will be made to the system and also the design of the changes. the document just included the list of files that will be changes to achieve the desired result.
1,yes it has the implementation plan of which allows the instructor to decide about review times. since that is the only thing to be implemented there no more issues. i think the diagram does have very pretty look it should be better if the screenshot can be smaller so that the fonts in the diagrams can be seen more clearly.
1,authors have given brief description of the subclass of questionnaire named that they are going to implement but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to implemented to achieve the goal.
1,the explanation is adequate. i would suggest that the design of the doc be more explicit. it may include some sub titles and the font should be of different sizes to emphasize some parts.
1,the authors gave enough explanations about the design for the ui parts. that is how will they design the ui and handle the problems related to ui but they didn give the design for how will they deal with the reviews differently when instructors check or check the box. i cannon identify how can they check if the box is checked in the code and how can they according to the status of the box to make sure the students can only update the previous reviews when the box is unchecked and students can require new reviews when the box is checked.
1,the authors have still only mentioned the ui side changes i.e. adding to control the functionality. they have not thought about the actual logic to limit the students from seeing the reviews. please include this in the design as this completes the entire functionality.
1,the authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. but as i mentioned in the earlier review whole paragraph on the background of is not required one or two sentences would have sufficed.
1,the design appears appropriate but since it is shallow it is hard to tell how sound it is. how will user be prevented from requesting another review. also the naming seems to assume either one or two rounds. what about more than two rounds.
1,the design seems good. however it would be better if the author can mention the design principles and patterns followed in the documentation.
1,design plan has not changed since i last reviewed. a bit more detail would still be nice
1,design doc does not explain the approach to resolve the issue to be taken well. as could see only lines of explanation. team should explain the design more clearly for naive users too. team has not used any design principle.
1,the design lacked enough explanation about how will they deal with reviews when the box is checked and unchecked. for the naming of the function and database the name seems too long. it is better to make the name shorter and easy to understand.
1,the team has submitted partial design and the part they have thought about is complete. the rest has not been thought through. please consider the design for the logic necessary to show hide the reviews for the students.
1,yes the design is simple. the design includes details in checking rounds when it bigger than or equal to add the and otherwise do nothing. however i doubt if that needed in design document. since in the future if we need to do round reviews this feature can be misleading.
1,it looks like sound but i think the authors could add some principles and patterns which they may use into 
1,team has added flow diagram and system screenshots. team could added diagrams so as to understand sequence of events or actors involved.
1,there only one diagram from the perspective of the user in terms of how the functionality should be like. it does clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. it should be better if there another diagram which explains the work flow in terms of which files we need to do at each step and what we need to do one step after another to implement the project.
1,the flowchart included concisely explains the functionality they plan to add. suggestion add diagrams for use case or sequence diagrams to explain their implementation design. this will make the design planned easier to follow.
1,they had diagrams. one for ui and one for the implementation. the implementation can me less words and more simple.
1,the team has not used many diagrams to explain the changes made in the project. they have just explained using simplified flowchart. no use case or er diagrams have been used to explain the changes made.
1,the manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality but information should be provided on automated testing.
1,team has not mentioned test cases that they are going to write. manual testing steps are mentioned. team should work on adding test cases as manual test does not help to check all the corners of the complex system well.
1,there a test plan. the test plan is deep and indeed tests the functionality. it should be better if the test plan also includes another step between and in terms of how to make the step student can or cannon do the second review without the first one.
1,the team has explained the manual testing process. suggestion include how the go functionality is actually tested in ruby. include edge cases for the testing functionality.
1,the team has written steps that are required to test the system. however they could improve this by adding test code that would test the basic functionality.
1,manual test plan as of now. try to automate it if possible.
1,all the tests have not been implemented. but the test plan has been described. could have included more test cases to extensively test the system. automated test could have been written.
1,the test plan is not adequate enough and little bit ambiguous. for the part there are many cases not included. for example the is unchecked by default in different cases the will show or not. for the student side for each case is not clear enough and i cannon identify what the anticipated results for these cases should be.
1,design concept seems promising but brief introduction about how each module will be implemented for both reviewer and is missing.
1,the design seems simple but it is unclear on the implementation section. the authors can add more on how they plan to add new code or modify existing implementations to achieve their goal.
1,the design is simple and easy to understand. could be better if implementing some code level design.
1,the use case diagrams are understandable but i think images of web pages will make things more clear.
1,the team has include the use case diagrams for all the scenarios related to the requirement. some ui would have helped otherwise great work.
1, and class diagram are needed. if the screenshot of the same functionality was given then it would have been better.
1,please add test plan to the documentation in order to make sure that the test plan is covering the code changes.
1,no. team did not mentioned anything under test should work on this part of project as well as manual testing will not help to check all the corners of the complex project.
1,there is only title for test plan which could be in great detail.
1,the team included test plan section is the documentation which is currently blank. the team should include the automated and manual test scenarios in the document.
1,the test plan section included in the design document does not provide any content. it could specify the various scenarios considered and describe how each functionality could be tested.
1,there is no test plan included in the design document. actually there should be lot of tests need to be done for this project. from the ui controller to model the project should include test plan cover all these aspects to make sure the function can work as intended.
1,the complexity is again big unknown to me as they have kept the algorithm as black box. it is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented if it is in controller and if yes in which controller. i suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. as of now i am clear about their input and output formats however i would like to know which functions do they interface with.
1,there were mock ups of how the analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric however there is no mock up for how the response would be i would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. i would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the api or just few.
1,the visualization includes screen mock up analyze button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. however there is no mock up of the screen of what will the output be like. the flow diagram is highly redundant according to me as it does not portray any additional information about the design. i would suggest them to provide sequence diagram of the algorithm methods so as to illustrate their changes.
1,i think more tests can be added
1,the team has included test plan in format by including the feature specification and two scenarios one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. no more test cases can be added to check if the team part in the project is implemented well. some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm for example to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects can be included.
1,the design document has incorporated test plans but they haven been explained neatly. only the skeleton for the tests has been provided they ve should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify.
1,their test plan includes test case for successfully displaying the pop up text message as son and displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment block of review comment box. try to include test cases where review message is absent i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. include test case where review segment has suggestion and test if the output says suggestion present. include negative test case for the the suggestion where suggestion is not given by the reviewer and test that the output says suggestion absent.
1,i am not convinced with the similar assignments table schema. for an assignment ax there is foreign key that points to an assignment ay such that ax can be an assignment in say and ay can be the same assignment in. but what if one of the reviews from assignment a which was in was really good and we need to include that as sample and also include another review from aw from as sample. according my understanding this above requirement cannon be met with the current db table design. something that the team may look into.
1,there is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. a better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.
1,the test plan gives black box testing view which is good and easy to understand. but it would be helpful to give more details about what are tested. like new db table is added. so tests related to that and corner cases such as an old assignment gets removed foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better.
1,the use case diagram added is drawn well and helps explaining the system. team could have added screenshots of the pages that would have helped us understand which part of the system is changing well.
1,team has added manual testing under test plan. team should also add automated test cases or brief plan on how they are going forward with automated testing of the changes.
1,the team has represented the workflow through the diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. however it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. the new table they are suggesting to make and the fields they would map to could be shown through entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.
1,i like the use case diagram but i would like class diagrams or database visualization too so it easier to understand how the cross course assignment linking will work.
1,some mock ui where this is going to be implemented would be helpful
1,the overall design looks good. however the author can add more details about the design principles being followed and appropriate patterns to be used.
1,the test plan seems to be covering most of the positive test cases. however it does seem to cover any negative test cases. like if the student decides not to make the review public its reviews should be shown to the ta instructor.
1,yes the problem statement and design approach sections explain clearly what the unease is and what the authors think will be good design to changes are clearly explained. having some file names would be useful to review in detail.
1,the unease diagram is helpful but does not help much as it just explains what is provided in the approach section. more in depth functionality of what each user will do or how will the design flow flow chart would be more helpful.
1,test plan is explained in detail. it covers integration testing and functional checks. however some unit testing of the new models should also be covered.
1,the authors have described solutions of the problem. however i would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur what files will be affected etc.
1,i can find any explanation for principles and patterns maybe the authors should add them to 
1,yes the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document.
1,the design is both simple and clear. it should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. both as final examination and testing.
1,yes the design is as simple as possible. however they have only described the proposed design. they could have provided simple mock ups or samples
1,the document is well explained. thus it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. however more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more.
1,the diagram only stated the current scenario. there no final picture no diagram. the figure didn clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. it should be better if there a diagram from the user practice side diagram for the design plan and also another figure for the final picture how down it look like when the plan is implemented.
1,no the proposed ui changes are only mentioned and the diagrams in the are of the current system. use radio for and drawings.
1,team has used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowcharts to describe how they are solving the problem is missing. adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better
1,there are no diagrams. i would suggest them to include test case diagram that can improve understandability
1,the testing appears to be pretty rigorous. they have taken into account cases when ta instructor scores should be excluded. the test cases could have been better described.
1,team has done good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. it will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller view separately.
1,the test plan is shallow. it only state what features the team will test but how the features will be test what and how many cases will be included are not clear. the team should expand the plan for each features they aim to test including specific steps and different cases.
1,both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. my only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.
1,design is fine. some minor errors like no stop no design patterns used. just flowcharts are provided some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design lot.
1,yes the design is pretty good. the patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. but i had made suggestion in review one to take look at project and it code. the problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. i don see any mention of it. i hope you do take look before starting to code as it will avoid any re work.
1,design is informative. but too detailed. one would have been apt.
1,the team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. but they have not used any class diagram.
1,yes the design includes the test plan. however the test plan could have been more low level instead of just writing it should statements.
1,a through test plan is described. i do think test case could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. overall looks good.
1,the could have been organized better. it looks little messy. not self explanatory. the use case does not have any actors in it. suggestion code screenshots could have been placed better
1,the files to be changed have been properly listed. i feel more explanation ought be given as to why these files have been modified and in what way.
1,less explanation on problem statement. could have elaborated on the problem scenario and why changes needs to be made.
1,the design looks fine team has provided the initial test plans. a lo fi sketch is available as well. the team could have put git links to the test plan code for better organization.
1,the authors have explained well on what changes they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented. as i had suggested in my previous review they can mention the files controllers views involved.
1,design is too detailed. i would suggest keeping it short and precise.
1,there is just one flow diagram which does explain the activities to happen. there is no use case diagram with actors and all the uses cases expected. suggestion the use case diagram would have given better clarity about the system
1,the design does include enough test plans. the team has provided the code screenshots for the same. suggestion could have put links to the git code so that the could have been short and precise.
1,the project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well defined in the design document. the team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes. the fix for the issue issue related to staggered deadline is backed up by discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code. one minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code. moreover the solution to the issue issue related to instructor assignment participation is not specific enough i.e. it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes. all in all the document does great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system.
1,flowcharts are simple to understand but no design patterns supporting class diagrams or sequence diagrams would be helpful.
1,you can add some more explanation of what exactly you ll do in issues like issue issue related to instructor assignment participation. i felt information is missing here.
1,fixes are simple adjustments to the current code. the last issue requires an addition of full function but i think that it is appropriate to handle the bug fix as it pulls that responsibility out and keeps things nicely separated and associated for purpose.
1, yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand. this can be attributed to the fact that their issues are quite simple in nature. they could have provided some simple ui of the changes.
1,for each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed. aside from the issue all the solutions seem reasonable and simple. one minor suggestion for improvement would be to use instead of teach method for computing total weight in validate assignment questionnaires weights method.
1, the visualization provided in the form of flow diagrams in very easy to understand. however er diagrams of main db tables could have been provided because it is difficult to understand the data flow and inter relation between tables.
1,could have included some screenshots. otherwise great work by the team on diagrams.
1,the test plan section defines the steps needed to manually test the but i would suggest the team to also include the logic they propose to use in the spec tests the objects they would mock etc.
1,test plan is included but it makes many references to manual tests. the tests they state could be automated in straight forward manner.
1,the test plan is present. it is broken down into separate sections for each of the five issues. each section is further broken down into manual and automated testing parts. while the sections for manual testing are comprehensive the sections for automated tests are too general and do not provide clear vision for what types of changes are going to be introduced. i would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the tests for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize spec
1,yes the changes to be made are nicely explain. the diagrams and screenshots are in place. suggestion there was more scope to the test plans
1,the design doc explains the project in detail. i would suggest that the description could be modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. also what mac files are being touched could have been mentioned.
1,the design does appear to be sound. the team has put most of the use cases actors and explained them well. the screenshots of the ui are also present. suggestion could have explained the implementation bit more in bullet points.
1,yes the team seem to have clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. it would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.
1,the diagrams are detailed and explained well. suggestion the application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.
1,the team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. it would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. they could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement. test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.
1,the test plan can be more elaborate and complete. this will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.
1,the design has been listed with few test plans. i feel that there could be more tests included. suggestion test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if add approach is used.
1,yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which must be test but does mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements
1,test plan is very shallow. only the headings are mentioned. a proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.
1,the current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as what happens if the deadline for self review is exceeded. does that mean the peer review scores cannon be seen. or is default score of is set.
1,they have paragraph saying what they are going to do but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
1,they have one scenario. maybe few more could help better test their work
1,yes the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score etc and then they will store the review however the solution is not concrete enough and is little bit hard to follow. it should be great if there more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.
1,the design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. i doubt if it follows the dry principle while looping through each review because that might be already done in the in terms of patterns i think here it needs to use the factory pattern although it not stated in the design.
1,the design is simple although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.
1,there are lot of diagrams but the application flow and the diagram does look very clear. we can hardly see the words in the diagram. also the diagrams seem to not fit each other. how does the application diagram and the diagram connect to each other. there no clear instructions. also i don think screen shot of code in the design doc is good idea. i think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in more abstract fashion.
1,there a testing plan. although the testing plan seems to cover the it is not clearly stated. the tester should log in as what role. how to select teams assignment and review it. how to log out and check the instructor email. which instructor email should the tester check. these questions should have been answered in the test plan.
1,the design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. the authors have done good job at explaining the current scenario also identified the code where the changes are to be made. they have identified the need of new function and its purpose but fail to provide design of the intended changes i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions any need to use different variables etc. the authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions.
1,as they have provided very high level idea of their proposed solution there is no or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. you can improvise the design by including flow of the methods to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. however looking at the intended modifications it seems that the changes follow dry principles and changes are not unnecessary. there is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.
1,the design does appear to be simple as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. their new method will interact with response model and then link the assignment to the review in the email. however they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. but suppose that storing it in variable will suffice.
1,the visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram and use cases. they are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. however sequence or communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other methods. this will help identify if the new method impacts other and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.
1,i think that there is huge scope for test plan improvisation. the current test plan is just step by step procedure to test if the reviewer receives mail fir conflicting reviews. the test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. also is the link correct and navigable. the test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.
1,design does seem to be sound but complex. as mentioned in the earlier review i am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. if so i would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.
1,the test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. checking the functionality manually and writing spec tests for the code written are extremely different and i would suggest the team to have dedicated test plan section mentioning the controller model they wish to test the objects they would need to mock etc.
1,some additional tests can be added
1,they used the diagrams it really help me lot when reading the page. maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.
1,they did include test plan. it would be better if they also test the instructor side.
1,author could have provided the design pattern they need to implement.
1,the test plan seems overly simplistic. it only tests whether the team changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. it seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.
1,team has added most of the missing screenshots. there will be no design patterns involved in bootstrap so d say the document is now complete. only thing would suggest is since may not have this document can be moved to page of repository.
1,the team have taken time to explain each functionality properly in the second round. they list all the changes that they wish to make in the views. however i would suggest the team to also mark out circle out the area they wish to change in the screenshot of the view.
1,explanations are okay there needs to be more detail on what is being done and how the final outlook view would be. as of now not much details have been put in the document. a before and after view would have adequately shown the impact the this work will make.
1,for the manage participant part the authors didn explain how will they solve the issue that the add student button cannon work correctly after user add course. the document included other changes need to be made but the explanation was not clear enough. the design used lot of components in bootstrap but the authors didn give any to these components they would use and didn give any diagrams to show what the changes will be like.
1,the authors only explain what needs to be changed but no specific steps. if would be better if they can provide more details about how will they implement the functions they mention in the document.
1,yes the document mainly talks about small changes at different places in the application that are being done. i think more implementation details with ample justification are missing. if the team is using certain apis why are they using should have been mentioned.
1,the design is not clear enough. more details are needed.
1,the design changes appear simple and clear. only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices little more. as mentioned above give an example of how where to use bootstrap and 
1,it an ui intensive project so no specific design approaches are applicable. but the team should have put it more details into the document to elaborate the changes and they choice of tools under the bootstrap framework. like pill or naval or naval is going to be used to achieve particular look and if one of them why the choice. such details on decisions should be included in the design document.
1,the team has provided current system ui but no expectations on the ui for this project. for an ui intensive project i believe it essential to have at least minimal wireframe that serves as the base for good design document so every stake holder can be on the same page with regard to expectations.
1,the authors provide some screenshot of the pages they need to change. it would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their design for example diagram about the relationship of all the class they need to change.
1,i meant to leave this blank. kindly ignore the rating for this question as this project does not require any tests. all the changes made are cos related.
1,yes design seems fit. more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.
1,yes the explanations provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned. the authors are very clear what and where to make changes. use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily. suggestion no test plan is included in the project
1,yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping track of the review time of student
1,actually they talked little about previous work from e project and lot about what they gonna do. but it better to have some contrast.
1,the design design document seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. though the team made any changes since the last update. the team could have added diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.
1,the design seems to follow appropriate principles and pattern. it is simple and clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. suggestion addition of screen mock ups to document will help reviewers lot.
1,the team has clearly defined the objective of the project. the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on particular review. the only thing the team could have added was to create diagram defining the classes that are changed or added and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified added. the team haven mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed plan explains the idea well.
1,the design document is very simple and easy to read. detailed explanation about the objective the proposed plan for each objective database schema and the user flow chart is defined clearly. the team could have added crc cards to improve detailing about the code changes.
1,the design in extremely simple to understand at first glance. but given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated the team has made efforts to make it as clear as possible.
1,yes the database design and flowchart gives clear picture what system will do after the required changes. suggestion add before after changes screen mock ups to your document.
1,as such the project description does not ask for any visualization but visualization in terms of diagram or crc cards would have been helpful way to make the description better.
1,visualization offers only flow chart but other diagrams like class diagram would have been more helpful.
1,no it does t. suggestion team should add test plan which includes tests for testing the required changes.
1,there is no test plan. for this project it could be difficult to test the exact time returned. however it would be good idea to test that the report page in fact shows the statistics.
1,no test plan is included. they can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope.
1,no test plan added they where missing the last time as well. you guys should add them telling how you exactly plan to test the changes you make even if its small change it should be mentioned how it was tested.
1,haven included the test plan
1,the use case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. it makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario.
